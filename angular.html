                        <h2>What is Angular</h2>
                        <p>Angular is a full featured JavaScript Framework created and maintained by Google and is used for building front end applications or the front-end element of a full stack application</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>AngularJS lets you extend HTML with HTML attributes called directives. There are three kinds of directives in Angular:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Components—directives with a template.</li>
                                        <li>Structural directives—change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements.</li>
                                        <li> Attribute directives—change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                <li>Angular is the next generation framework where each tool was designed to work with every other tool in an interconnected way</li>
                                <li>REACT is currently more popular JS frameworks</li>
                                <li>AngularJS is not Angular and AngularJS should be avoided</li>

                        <h2>Setting Up an Angular application</h2>
                        <p>You are about to embark on an extraordinary journey. Writing JavaScript is a lot of fun, but writing an Angular 2 application with TypeScript is pure joy. In this course we'll cover the basics of building an Angular 2 application.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Sound cloud is a angular app which taps into the soundcloup api. The Api links to a database were the information is stored</li>
                                <li>Angular is modular giving you control over your code. When passed to the browser it will be in its simpliest form</li>
                                <li>Angular is built on a static lanuage called TypeScript. Static lanuage allows you to spend less time reading documentation and more time building your application</li>
                            </ul>

                            <ul>
                                <li>A Angular application is built from a collection of modules. A app needs to have one root module which is were the application starts

                                </li>
                                <li>Angular consists of Services, Components and 3rd Party Modules
                                    <br><img src="Images/Angular requirements.jpg" alt=""></li>
                                <li>Components are made up of the following: templates, Styles and Business Logic</li>
                                <li>Ng is the namespace Angular adopted so developers can easily identify parts of the Angular platform. (example: NgModule, NgForms, ngOnInit)</li>
                                <li><a href="https://webpack.js.org/" target="_blank">Webpack</a> is used for packing Angular applications. Webpack is a module loader.</li>

                        <h2>The Importance of Static Typing in Angular</h2>
                        <p>You can write an Angular application in either JavaScript or TypeScript. In this course we'll be using TypeScript. TypeScript provides a lot of extra features not found in JavaScript.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Typescript is a type superset of JavaScript</li>
                                <li>TypeScript proivdes the releveant documentation in the code editor making is easy to resolve issues quickly</li>
