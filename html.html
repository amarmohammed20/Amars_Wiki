                            <p>HTML is understood by all browsers, from browsers on phones, to tablets to desktop computers. That's why every website and web app you use is made using HTML -- it's the language of the web!</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>HTML provides the structure of you website/app, being the foundation of any great website/app</li>
                                    <li>A website has three layers, content (What you see on the page), Presentation Layer(How that presentation looks) and behaviour layer(interaction on the page)</li>
                                    <li>Css provides the presentation layer</li>
                                    <li>Javascript provides behaviour layer, interaction</li>
                                    <li>HTML provides the content layer, forms the structure</li>
                                    <li>Markup lanuage provides meaning to text in a document</li>
                                    <li>Tags are used in markup to provide formatting and structure to your page</li>

                            <h2>Global Structure of an HTML Document</h2>
                            <p>Even though most web pages look different from one another, every web page follows a common HTML structure.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The homepage of a website of app that is used as the landing page is normally called index.html</li>
                                    <li>The head of a html document starts the same normally and than expands on your requirements. In VS type ! and than tab and you will be provided with the below 
                                        <br><img src="Images/html head.jpg" alt=""></li>
                                    <li>When using a html tag the ending tag should have / before.</li>
                                    <li><a href="http://www.bu.edu/tech/services/cccs/websites/www/non-wordpress/start/html-introduction/syntax/nesting-tags/" target="_blank">Nesting</a> should be used for tags, this is best practice</li>
                                    <li>Nesting should be two tabs spacing for everything in the html tags and one tab spacing for other nested elements</li>
                                    <li>Any content you want to display in the browser is placed into the body tags</li>
                                    <li>A good resource for html elements is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element" target="_blank">MDN</a> website</li>
                                    <li>You should only ever have one title and body element in a HTML page</li>
                                    <li>The head element provides general information about the document, like the title and links to style sheets</li>
                                    <li>The version of HTML is defined in the DOCTYPE tag at the start of the HTML page</li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>To format content we mainly use heading tags and paragraph tags. Heading tags have different levels
                                        <br><img src="Images/HTML h tags.jpg" alt=""></li>
                                    <li>The above works as a scale h1 shows the most importance and h6 shows the least</li>
                                    <li>To insert a line break you use the br element</li>
                                    <li>To add a seperator line in HTML you can use the HTML element hr which is a horizontal line</li>
                                    <li>To comment in HTML you use the below: 
                                        <br><img src="Images/HTML Comments.jpg" alt=""></li>
                                    <li>For HTML lists you can use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul" target="_blank">ul</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol" target="_blank">ol</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl" target="_blank">dl</a>

                                    <li>The a tag uses attributes to provide more information on what it is being used for. The href is the atrribute used in this example for the anchor tag to link to another website</li>

                            <h2>Semantic HTML: header, footer and section</h2>
                            <p>HTML's role in web design and development is to provide structure and meaning to content. In this video, you'll begin learning HTML's set of elements that describe sections of content.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics" target="_blank">Semantic</a> HTML - Markup that describes the meaning of content instead of how it looks</li>
                                    <li>A example is that a /p tag and a /h tag but display text but have different meanings</li>
                                    <li>Semantic is used to example your inofmration to search engines</li>
                                    <li>Semantic is also used for assisted users who might be visually impared</li>
                                    <li>Below illustrates Semantics, elements that provide structure to the pages, such as header and footer.
                                        <br><img src="Images/header footer html.jpg" alt=""></li>
                                    <li>The <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_head.asp" target="_blank">head</a> tag is used for holding Meta information, title, links, etc. and is not displayed on the page. The <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_header.asp" target="_blank">header</a> tag is used within the body of the website and can be used multiple times if required, e.g. to determine the top of an article. </li>
                                    <li>The HTML <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer" target="_blank">footer</a>element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element. A footer typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.</li>
                                    <li>The SECTION element is defined as a semantic section of a web page or site that isn't another more specific type. I tend to use this element when I am marking up a distinct section of the page - a section that could wholesale be moved and used on other pages or parts of the site. It is a distinct piece of content, or a "section" of content, if you will.
                                    <br> In contrast, you use the DIV element for parts of the page that you want to divide up, but for purposes other than semantics.</li>
                                    <li>At the start of every section there should be a heading indicating what that section is about</li>
                                    <li>The HTML <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article" target="_blank">article</a> element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry.</li>
                                    <li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav" target="_blank">nav</a> element is used to provide navigation within the structure, this could be a link</li>
                                    <li>The nav element is normally used for main links around the page/website. Like the navigation buttons that take you to different pages
                                        <br><img src="Images/HTML nav element.jpg" alt=""></li>
                                    <li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside" target="_blank">aside</a> element are normally buttons on the side of the page, represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.</li>
                                    <li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q" target="_blank">q</a> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation. Most modern browsers implement this by surrounding the text in quotation marks. This element is intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks; for long quotations use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote" target="_blank">blockquote</a> element. </li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Marking Up a Blog Post</h3>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>First you need a title, header and footer elements. This information should be able to be pulled out and put into another blog</li>
                                        <li>To wrap the content of the blog post in article tags</li>
                                        <li>Use a h2 tag within the article tag to give the blog post a heading</li>
                                        <li>An aside tag can be used to display information that is associated to the article but not directly. If removed the article would still make sense. A good example of this when using a quote from/associated to the article.</li>
                                        <li>If a aside element is placed outside the article should be information related to the whole page not just the article. Example could be a navigation on the side of social media icons</li>
                                        <li>The below image displays a correctly structured blog post. Green being the header,footer and navigation that can be copied and pasted to other blog posts. The yellow which is the blog wrapped in article tags and the blue which is aside information that can be removed and the blog still makes sense
                                            <br><img src="Images/HTML Blog Template.jpg" alt=""></li>

                                <h3>Grouping Content with main and div elements</h3>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The HTML <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main" target="_blank">main</a> element represents the dominant content of the body of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.</li>
                                        <li>The HTML Content Division element <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div" target="_blank">div</a> is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled using CSS.</li>
                                        <li>The HTML Citation element <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite" target="_blank">cite</a> is used to describe a reference to a cited creative work, and must include the title of that work. The reference may be in an abbreviated form according to context-appropriate conventions related to citation metadata.</li>
                                        <li>You should use the main tag once in a page and not include information the can be repeated across other pages</li>
                                        <li>The div element is used as a container and has no semantic meaning at all</li>
                                        <li>Using a div at the start of the body is called uisng a wrapper and it controls things like the width alignment and so on.</li>
                                        <li>blockquote tag is used to block a long quote, cite can be used to were you got the information from. You can wrap the cite in a footer attributing the text to the author
                                            <br><img src="Images/blockquote html.jpg" alt=""> </li>

                                <p>You can use multiple footer and header elements in one page. You nest footers inside other elements to contain footer information for that section of the page. Nested headers represent introductory content for a section of the page.</p>
                                    <ul>
