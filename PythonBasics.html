            <h2>What is Python</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank"></a> Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Compared to JavaScript - Python's "object-based" subset is roughly equivalent to JavaScript. Like JavaScript (and unlike Java), Python supports a programming style that uses simple functions and variables without engaging in class definitions. However, for JavaScript, that's all there is. Python, on the other hand, supports writing much larger programs and better code reuse through a true object-oriented programming style, where classes and inheritance play an important role.</li>

The PSF’s mission is to advance open source technology related to the Python programming language and to publicize the use of Python.

                <li>Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language that can be applied to many different classes of problems.</li>
