                        <h2>CSS Basics - Getting started</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>CSS stands for cascading style sheets - core technology to designing a website. The presentation of the website</li>
                                <li>CSS resource <a href="https://www.webplatform.org/docs/css/" target = "_blank"></a>Webplatform.org</li>
                                <li>The three meathods you can apply CSS to a website <br>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Inline style - Write the CSS in the HTML file inside the tag. Not good practice. Inline style will override all other style applied
                                        <br><img src="Images/Css inline style.jpg" alt=""></li>
                                        <li>Internal styles - Placed in the HTML documents in the head tag and placed in style tags. A inline style will override this. The HTML file becomes to big and the css is realoded after every refresh
                                        <br><img src="Images/Internal Style CSS.jpg" alt=""></li>
                                        <li>External CSS - This is an external .css file which is managed seperatley. Need to link the file to the HTML - link tag with rel= which is relationship which is stylesheet and href 
                                        <br><img src="Images/External CSS Style.jpg" alt=""></li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>You can also import a style sheet - This is placed on the HTML in the head tags inbetween style tags. Example @import ""; 
                                <br>You can also and is preferred to place the import in the .css stylesheet which is seperate. </li>
                            </ul>

                        <h2>CSS - Basic Selectors</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A css selector is created of two parts, the property and the value
                                <br><img src="Images/CSS selector.jpg" alt=""></li>
                                <li>A selector lets us target HTML elements. </li>
                                <li>A universal selector selects every element on the page at once, overriding all other css. * {} <br>
                                <img src="Images/css universal selector.jpg" alt=""> </li>
                                <li>A type selector lets you select a element type on the page, also called html selectors. Example p {}. Wrtie these in the order they appear in the HTML file to keep things neat <br>
                                <img src="Images/css type selector.jpg" alt="">  </li>
                                <li>ID selector, this is were you place a ID in the HTML tag and than call is out in the external CSS file using #. Example #primary-content {} <br>
                                An element can only have one ID and only one element can have the same ID name</li>
                                <li>ID's can also be used as anchor elements for the page. You can call the ID as an anchor through a href</li>
                                <li>Class selectors - A class is like a ID but an ID is used for one element and a class is used for many elements <br>
                                To call a class selector you use . Example .primary-content . Multiple elements can share the same class. <br>
                                An example of were this might be used is we could have multiple divs that require the same formatting. We use a class once instead of multiple ID's</li>
                                <li>You can add multiple classes in a HTML element which means that in the css file you can have one class that done the common things that most elements need, like font.</li>
                                <li>ID's carry more weight than classes as they point to a particular element. </li>
                                <li>You can use descendant selectors in CSS to capture the decendants of a element you are applying style to. An example for the span selector which is a child of the header <br>
                                <img src="Images/css descendant selector.jpg" alt=""> <br>
                                descendant selectors can be used with classes and ID's</li>
                                <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes" target="_blank"> Pseudo-Classes</a> are similiar to classes but specifies a special state of the selected element(s). <br>
                                For example, :hover can be used to change a button's color when the user's pointer hovers over it. <br>
                                <img src="Images/css pseudo-class.jpg" alt=""> <br>
                                <img src="Images/css 2 pseudo-class.jpg" alt=""><br>
                                Pseudo-Classes can be applied to any HTML elements</li>
                                <li>You can group two css selectors - <b> .main-header, h1</b></li>
                                <li>To comment in CSS you use /* */ - Shortcut is control /</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h2>CSS - Values and Units</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li><img src="Images/CSS values structure.jpg" alt=""></li>
                                <li>CSS has many data types - <a href="https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/tag/CSS%20Data%20Type" type="_blank">MDN CSS data types</a></li>
                                <li>Some length units for layout and screen size. px dont scale better to use % values. The two types are called relative and absaloute length values</li>
                                <li>The CSS pixel "px" unit is an abstract reference unit. the px value will automatically scale up for a device that is higher resolution. <br>
                                <img src="Images/css px example.jpg" alt=""></li>
                                <li>We can use a percentage unit. This unit adjusts and is fluid. </li>
                                <li>Using a % for font size the font size will be that percentage bigger than the default size of 16px - Example 150% would be 24px</li>
                                <li>em unit is a font relative unit - 1em is equal to the font-size value of the parent element - 1em = 16px - 3em - 48px <br>
                                The below calcualtion is for em values. 16eing 1em the standard font size for the browser. the result being the em value <br>

                                <li>rem unit is similiar to a em unit but are not affected by compounding. They are only relative to the standard 16px font size that comes with HTML</li>

                                RGB(red, green, blue) also known as a hex value - Examples - #ff0088 - rgb(255, 255, 255). To show some transparency you use a alpha value rgba(255, 255, 255, .5). .5 is 50%  </li>
                                <li>Text properties could be things like text-align: centre; - text-transform: uppercase; - </li>

                                Ensure to have the font saved on the computer of linked. <br>
                                You can have multiple fonts asking the computer to use the font font it has access to. <br>

                                If a font is made up of more than one work you have to use "". Example "Helvetica Neue".</li>
                                <li>Line height can be used to space out lines - line-height: - Can accept many units but should use a unit like word - 1.5 - This line height will adjust to the font size <br>
                                Short hand can be used - font: normal 1em/1.5 Helvetica - The order is important - <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/font-shorthand/" target="_blank"></a> Resource</li>

                        <h2>CSS - Box Model</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The box model is the amount of space each element takes up on the page. <br>
                                    <img src="Images/CSS box model.jpg" alt=""></li>
                                <li>A block element takes up the full width of the element and creates a new line before and after the element. Examples of some of these elements are - div, p, h and li </li>
                                <li>Inline elements only take up the width they need to and always stay inline. examples, anchor, images and span. </li>
                                <li>The box is made up of 4 elements - content, padding, border and margin <br>
                                    <img src="Images/CSS box explained.jpg" alt=""></li>
                                <li>Padding can be set in two ways - px and . Below is padding long hand and short hand <br>
                                    <img src="Images/padding long hand.jpg" alt=""> <br>
                                    Top - Right - Bottom - Left <img src="Images/padding short hand.jpg" alt=""></li>
                                <li>Best to use % values for padding, makes this fluid</li>
                                <li>Borders - border-width: - Ensure to also apply a border style. Also set the border a color. </li>
                                <li>margin accepts % and length. Border, margin and padding use the short hand - Top - Right - Bottom - Left <br>
                                    margin is applied outside of the box. margin: auto; sets all the margins for the lement to be equal</li>
                                <li>Display property can override the default values. The keyword values are - none (disappears), block(for divs, p , h. changes inline to block), inline(opposite of block, a element)  and inline block()</li>
                                <li>block covers the full width and inline goes inline with other text</li>
                                <li>You also have <b>display: inline-block</b>. This works as a block which is inline with other text. You can now adding margins</li>
                            </ul>

                        <ul>
                          <li>Float positioning - very common, used to take the lement out of its position allowing you to wrap other elemnts around it</li>
                          <li>Floats have a common issue as it will display on top of other content, this is becuase it is taken out of the normal structure of the page. <br>
                            To resolve this use <b>overflow: auto;</b>. Do this to the element above. A better way to do this is - <br>
                            instead of the above use <b>clear: both;</b> See image - give the parent element the class group. <br>

                                <li>Importance - depends on the origin of the style sheet. The external style sheet we write has more importance than both user agent styles and user styles</li>

                                <li><img src="Images/CSS Flex 2.png" alt=""></li>
                                <li>In the below you assign the display property to the red box which is the flex container. Inside that we have child elements which are flex items. 
                                <br><img src="Images/Felxbox example.png" alt=""></li>
                                <li>In Flexbox you have the main and the cross axis. main being - X  and cross being - Y</li>
                                <li><img src="Images/Flex Properties.png" alt=""></li>
                                <li>In the below example we have three boxes. You will see the HTML is wrapped in one main div with the class container1 and then each indivual box is wrapped in the div box- . In the css the main div has the class of display - flex.
                                    <br><img src="Images/Flex example.png" alt=""></li>
                                <li>The above so far would give you three boxes of equal size. If you wanted one box to have more room than other would would apple the property to each box div as below. This makes Box One twice as big as before resulting in being bigger then two and three.
                                    <br><img src="Images/Flex example 2.png" alt=""></li>
                                <li>We can reorder the boxes moving them into different locations. The property <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_order.asp" target="_blank">Order</a> is used. See below
                                <br><img src="Images/Flex example 3.png" alt=""></li>
                                <li>If you want each box to size according to the content you use the property <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_align-items.asp" target="_blank">align-items</a>:flex-start;. The default for the property align-items is streched.
                                <br><img src="Images/Flex example 4.png" alt=""></li>
                                <li>By default the box are displayed as rows. The property that determines this is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_flex-direction.asp" target="_blank">flex-direction</a>.

                                <li>We can determine the width of a box or boxes by applying a width to the divs or each indiviual boxes 
                                    <br><img src="Images/flex width.png" alt=""></li>
                                <li>If you want to place a space between each box you can apply the property <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_justify-content.asp" target="_blank">justify-content</a> to the main container that wraps all the boxes
                                <br><img src="Images/flex justify.png" alt=""></li>
                                <li>Instead of using width on the boxes you should use the property <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_flex-basis.asp" target="_blank">flex-basis</a></li>
                                <li>We can use <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp" target="_blank">media query</a> to ensure the boxes are displayed correctly for the screen size. We can state as below show the current layout only when the screen size is minimum of 768px other display the boxes in indiviual columns

                        <h2>CSS Grids</h2>
                        <p>CSS Grid Layout provides a built-in, more efficient way of designing grid-based layouts in the browser. <br>
                           It brings a new set of properties, functions and flexible units that let you control the exact placement and sizing of grid components.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Keep design organised and positioning. Above we have used inline blocks and floats and tables to achieve this but Grids are a better way</li>
                                <li>Can build layouts faster - Grid is your layout system <br>

                                <li>Grid and Flexbox each have thier specialties; they are complementary layout tools</li>
                                <li>Below is a example to explain grids - The HTML and the css. This examples shows HTML in the body with the div that has a class called grid <br>
                                <img src="Images/Grid HTML example.jpg" alt=""></li>
                                <li>First set a HTML element with the class grid(You can name it whatever you want) that will hold all within the grid. <br>
                                The main css properties you will apply to the class is <b style="color: red;">display: grid;</b>. <br>
                                By defualt the grid container places its items in a single column. </li>
                                <li>Grid tracks - What are they? - You use the <b style="color: red;">grid-template-columns</b> property to set the grid tracks <br>
                                <img src="Images/Grid Tracks.jpg" alt=""> <br>
                                Each value in the track list specifes the size of a column or row. Below creates three columns 200px wide <br>

                                <img src="Images/Three tracks browser.jpg" alt=""></li>
                                <li>Grid rows - you use <b style="color: red;">grid-template-rows</b> to set the rows in a grid</li>
                                <li>If you add more items to the html the grid-templates-columns will be followed everything going into three columns</li>
                                <li>Add Gutters Between Rows and Columns - CSS Grid gives you control over the spaces (or gutters) between columns and rows. You separate grid tracks using the grid-row-gap and grid-column-gap properties. <br>
                                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-row-gap" target="_blank">grid-row-gap - MDN</a>

                                <li>To create a gutter in the grid you can use <b style="color: red;">grid-column-gap</b> and <b style="color: red;">grid-row-gap</b>. <br>
                                This simply means you will get spacing between the columns and rows <br>

                                <li>The short hand is <b style="color: red;">grid-gap:</b>. The first value is the row and the second is the column. One value is for both columns and rows</li>
                                <li>for each column you need two lines so for column 1 you need lines 1 and 2. Same for rows. You can places items in particular boxes in the grid<br>

                        <h2>Flexible Sized CSS Grids</h2>
                        <p>Grid Layout introduces new features that adapt content to available space and intelligently size and position items within a grid container. <br>
                           This supports responsive design and makes it easier to create layouts that work in a variety of different browser sizes, without the use of media queries.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Flexible Sized grids support responsive design. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout#The_fr_Unit" target="_blank">fr</a> is used design the size of the columns ensuring they are responsive</li>
                                <li>This also iradicates the need of media querys, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp" target="_blank"> media query</a></li>
                                <li>The below example displays that the first and second column is a fixed width but the middle column is flexible and will expand to the remaining space <br>
                                <img src="Images/fr example.jpg" alt=""></li>
                                <li>If you have three columns with the same width you can use <b style="color: red;">grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);</b></li>
                                <li>You can use min and max to determine the columns and rows (tracks). <br>
                                The function accepts two values, the first being min and the second being max. <b style="color: red;">minmax(200px, 300px)</b>. You can use fr for max value <br>
                                The repeat can be used for the above <br>
                                <img src="Images/repeat minmax.jpg" alt=""></li>
                                <li>When the browser becomes to small we need the containers to wrap onto the next line. info on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/repeat#Values" target="_blank">repeat</a></li>
                                <li>the below exmaple will move columns to the next line while keeping a min and max for all columns <br>
                                <img src="Images/auto fill repeat.jpg" alt=""></li>
                                <li>replacing auto-fill above to auto-fit you wont be left with white spacing and you will have the responsive action</li>
                                <li>To conclude were you would stipulate the number of columns at the start of the repeat so place auto-fit</li>
                                <li>You can face a problem when you data is dynamic on the site and you end up needing more columns than you have specified <br>

                                <li>We have previously been speaking about explicit grids, were we determine columns but to ensure the grid can grow we use implicit grids <br>
                                <img src="Images/implicit grid.jpg" alt=""></li>
                                <li>implicit rows are auto sized and the amount/size of the content determines there size</li>
                                <li>To determine the size of the implicit row you can use <br>

                                <li>The function in css for the above is <b style="color: red;">grid-auto-rows: 250px;</b>. Any implicit row will be this size now</li>

                                <li>In summary you have explicit and implicit columns and rows. explicit you decide all the sizes and implicit you set one size and any new columns or rows they follow that size, otherwise they take the size of the content. </li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Firefox has a very good tool for grids - <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Examine_grid_layouts" target="_blank">CSS Grid Inspector: Examine grid layouts</a></li>
                                <li>Right click and inspect element <img src="Images/Firefox Grid inspector.jpg" alt=""></li>
                                <li>Line base placement control what goes into what part of the grid - <b style="color: red;">grid-column-start: ;</b> and <b style="color: red;">grid-column-end: ;</b> <br>
                                The start is the grid line we want to start from and end is the grid line we want to end. </li>
                                <li>The below example makes the header take up the full width of the top of the page <br>

                                <li>A example of a negative grid line being used. This is to make the header go across the full width of the page ignoring the number of grid lines, the <b>grid-column-end</b> has to be negative 1 <br>
                                This also means if new columns we added the header would still strech across the full width of the screen <br>
