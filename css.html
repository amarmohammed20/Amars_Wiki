      <p>Useful resource <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS" target = "_blank">MDN CSS</a></p>
      
    <h2>CSS Basics - Getting started</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>CSS stands for cascading style sheets - core technology to designing a website. The presentation of the website</li>
        <li>CSS resource <a href="https://www.webplatform.org/docs/css/" target = "_blank"></a>Webplatofrm.org</li>
        <li>The three meathods you can apply CSS to a website <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Inline style - Write the CSS in the HTML file inside the tag. Not good practice. Inline style will override all other style applied<br>
              <img src="Images/Css inline style.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>Internal styles - Placed in the HTML documents in the head tag and placed in style tags. A inline style will override this. The HTML file becomes to big and the css is realoded after every refresh<br>
              <img src="Images/Internal Style CSS.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>External CSS - This is an external .css file which is managed seperatley. Need to link the file to the HTML - link tag with rel= which is relationship which is stylesheet and href <br>
              <img src="Images/External CSS Style.jpg" alt=""></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>You can also import a style sheet - This is placed on the HTML in the head tags inbetween style tags. Example @import ""; <br>
          You can also and is preferred to place the import in the .css stylesheet which is seperate. </li>
      </ul>

    <h2>CSS - Basic Selectors</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A css selector is created of two parts, the property and the value <br>
          <img src="Images/CSS selector.jpg" alt=""></li>
        <li>A selector lets us target HTML elements. </li>
        <li>A universal selector selects every element on the page at once, overriding all other css. * {} <br>
          <img src="Images/css universal selector.jpg" alt=""> </li>
        <li>A type selector lets you select a element type on the page, also called html selectors. Example p {}. Wrtie these in the order they appear in the HTML file to keep things neat <br>
          <img src="Images/css type selector.jpg" alt="">  </li>
        <li>ID selector, this is were you place a ID in the HTML tag and than call is out in the external CSS file using #. Example #primary-content {} <br>
          An element can only have one ID and only one element can have the same ID name</li>
        <li>ID's can also be used as anchor elements for the page. You can call the ID as an anchor through a href</li>
        <li>Class selectors - A class is like a ID but an ID is used for one element and a class is used for many elements <br>
          To call a class selector you use . Example .primary-content . Multiple elements can share the same class. <br>
          An example of were this might be used is we could have multiple divs that require the same formatting. We use a class once instead of multiple ID's</li>
        <li>You can add multiple classes in a HTML element which means that in the css file you can have one class that done the common things that most elements need, like font.</li>
        <li>ID's carry more weight than classes as they point to a particular element. </li>
        <li>You can use descendant selectors in CSS to capture the decendants of a element you are applying style to. An example for the span selector which is a child of the header <br>
          <img src="Images/css descendant selector.jpg" alt=""> <br>
          descendant selectors can be used with classes and ID's</li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes" target="_blank"> Pseudo-Classes</a> are similiar to classes but specifies a special state of the selected element(s). <br>
          For example, :hover can be used to change a button's color when the user's pointer hovers over it. <br>
          <img src="Images/css pseudo-class.jpg" alt=""> <br>
          <img src="Images/css 2 pseudo-class.jpg" alt=""><br>
          Pseudo-Classes can be applied to any HTML elements</li>
        <li>You can group two css selectors - <b> .main-header, h1</b></li>
        <li>To comment in CSS you use /* */ - Shortcut is control /</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>CSS - Values and Units</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><img src="Images/CSS values structure.jpg" alt=""></li>
        <li>CSS has many data types - <a href="https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/tag/CSS%20Data%20Type" type="_blank">MDN CSS data types</a></li>
        <li>Some length units for layout and screen size. px dont scale better to use % values. The two types are called relative and absaloute length values</li>
        <li>The CSS pixel "px" unit is an abstract reference unit. the px value will automatically scale up for a device that is higher resolution. <br>
          <img src="Images/css px example.jpg" alt=""></li>
        <li>We can use a percentage unit. This unit adjusts and is fluid. </li>
        <li>Using a % for font size the font size will be that percentage bigger than the default size of 16px - Example 150% would be 24px</li>
        <li>em unit is a font relative unit - 1em is equal to the font-size value of the parent element - 1em = 16px - 3em - 48px <br>
          The below calcualtion is for em values. 16eing 1em the standard font size for the browser. the result being the em value <br>
          <img src="Images/css em calculation.jpg" alt=""> <br>
          <a href="http://pxtoem.com/" target="_blank">Conversion calculator</a></li>
        <li>You have to be careful of <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/community/trying-to-wrap-my-head-around-the-compounding-effect-can-someone-try-and-explain-it-using-a-different-approach" target="_blank">Compounding</a> affect of em units</li>
        <li>rem unit is similiar to a em unit but are not affected by compounding. They are only relative to the standard 16px font size that comes with HTML</li>
        <li><img src="Images/which one to use.jpg" alt=""></li>
        <li>Color Values, a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value" target="_blank">resource MDN</a> <br>
           Key word value(blue) <br>
           RGB(red, green, blue) also known as a hex value - Examples - #ff0088 - rgb(255, 255, 255). To show some transparency you use a alpha value rgba(255, 255, 255, .5). .5 is 50%  </li>
        <li>Text properties could be things like text-align: centre; - text-transform: uppercase; - </li>
        <li>Font properties - <a href="http://www.cssfontstack.com/" target="_blank">MDN Resource</a> <br>
          Ensure to have the font saved on the computer of linked. <br>
          You can have multiple fonts asking the computer to use the font font it has access to. <br>
          <img src="Images/css Multiple fonts.jpg" alt=""> <br>
          If a font is made up of more than one work you have to use "". Example "Helvetica Neue".</li>
        <li>Line height can be used to space out lines - line-height: - Can accept many units but should use a unit like word - 1.5 - This line height will adjust to the font size <br>
          Short hand can be used - font: normal 1em/1.5 Helvetica - The order is important - <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/font-shorthand/" target="_blank"></a> Resource</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>CSS - Box Model</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The box model is the amount of space each element takes up on the page. <br>
          <img src="Images/CSS box model.jpg" alt=""></li>
        <li>A block element takes up the full width of the element and creates a new line before and after the element. Examples of some of these elements are - div, p, h and li </li>
        <li>Inline elements only take up the width they need to and always stay inline. examples, anchor, images and span. </li>
        <li>The box is made up of 4 elements - content, padding, border and margin <br>
          <img src="Images/CSS box explained.jpg" alt=""></li>
        <li>Padding can be set in two ways - px and . Below is padding long hand and short hand <br>
          <img src="Images/padding long hand.jpg" alt=""> <br>
          Top - Right - Bottom - Left <img src="Images/padding short hand.jpg" alt=""></li>
        <li>Best to use % values for padding, makes this fluid</li>
        <li>Borders - border-width: - Ensure to also apply a border style. Also set the border a color. </li>
        <li>margin accepts % and length. Border, margin and padding use the short hand - Top - Right - Bottom - Left <br>
          margin is applied outside of the box. margin: auto; sets all the margins for the lement to be equal</li>
        <li>Display property can override the default values. The keyword values are - none (disappears), block(for divs, p , h. changes inline to block), inline(opposite of block, a element)  and inline block()</li>
        <li>block covers the full width and inline goes inline with other text</li>
        <li>You also have <b>display: inline-block</b>. This works as a block which is inline with other text. You can now adding margins</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>CSS - Floats</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Float positioning - very common, used to take the lement out of its position allowing you to wrap other elemnts around it</li>
        <li>Floats have a common issue as it will display on top of other content, this is becuase it is taken out of the normal structure of the page. <br>
          To resolve this use <b>overflow: auto;</b>. Do this to the element above. A better way to do this is - <br>
          instead of the above use <b>clear: both;</b> See image - give the parent element the class group. <br>
          <img src="Images/float clear fix.jpg" alt=""></li>
        <li></li>
      </ul>

    <h2>CSS - Media Query Basics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>some info <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries" target="_blank">CSS media queries - MDN</a>, also <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries#Media_features" target="_blank">Media features</a>, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh?hl=en" target="_blank">Window Resizer - Resize browser window to emulate various screen resolutions</a></li>
        <li>This is used to handle different sizes and deifferent devices. This allow you to respond and adapt.</li>
        <li>A style block containing one or more conditions. <b>@media ()</b> <br>
          There are a few media types - all(all devices) and so on. <br>
          <b>@media all ()</b>. Inside the () write an expression you are checking for. No ; after the last argument in the ()</li>
        <li>multiple media queries - <br>

      </ul>
      
    <h2>CSS - Fundamental Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Cascading means whats detemrines which style is determined to the element</li>
        <li><img src="Images/cascade resolve issue.jpg" alt=""></li>
        <li>The above picture demonstrates a issue were we have applied a style to the same element in two places <br>
          <img src="Images/cascade explained.jpg" alt=""></li>
        <li>Importance - depends on the origin of the style sheet. The external style sheet we write has more importance than both user agent styles and user styles</li>
        <li>Specificity - decides which styles are applied. Styles that are applied to more specific selectors first. <br>
          <img src="Images/Specificity example.jpg" alt=""> <br>
          The above example would be slategrey as it comes from a ID and is the last mentioned <br>
          <img src="Images/Specificity example 2.jpg" alt=""> <br>
          The above exmaple is tomamto as it is a inline style</li>
        <li>If two style sheets were linked in the header the last one would take priority <br>
          <img src="Images/two style sheets.jpg" alt=""></li>
        <li>Inheritance in CSS - This means styles are taken from parent elements. </li>
        <li>Go out and practice!!! - Be and active learner - Also use <a href="www.codepen.io" target="_blank">Code Pen</a></li>

    <h2>CSS Flexbox</h2>
      <ul>
        <li></li>
      </ul>

    <h2>CSS Grids</h2>
    <p>CSS Grid Layout provides a built-in, more efficient way of designing grid-based layouts in the browser. <br>
       It brings a new set of properties, functions and flexible units that let you control the exact placement and sizing of grid components.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep design organised and positioning. Above we have used inline blocks and floats and tables to achieve this but Grids are a better way</li>
        <li>Can build layouts faster - Grid is your layout system <br>
          <img src="Images/Flex vs grid.jpg" alt=""></li>

        <li>Grid containers - <img src="Images/Grid Container.jpg" alt=""><br>
          Grid Items - <img src="Images/Grid Items.jpg" alt=""> </li>
        <li>The below is a example were the main element is the container and the article tags are the items <br>
          <img src="Images/Grid container and items example.jpg" alt=""> <br>
          <img src="Images/grid illustration.jpg" alt=""></li>
        <li>Grids use grid lines <br>
          <img src="Images/Grid Columns and Rows.jpg" alt=""></li>
        <li>Grid and Flexbox each have thier specialties; they are complementary layout tools</li>
        <li>Below is a example to explain grids - The HTML and the css. This examples shows HTML in the body with the div that has a class called grid <br>
          <img src="Images/Grid HTML example.jpg" alt=""></li>
        <li>First set a HTML element with the class grid(You can name it whatever you want) that will hold all within the grid. <br>
          The main css properties you will apply to the class is <b style="color: red;">display: grid;</b>. <br>
          By defualt the grid container places its items in a single column. </li>
        <li>Grid tracks - What are they? - You use the <b style="color: red;">grid-template-columns</b> property to set the grid tracks <br>
          <img src="Images/Grid Tracks.jpg" alt=""> <br>
          Each value in the track list specifes the size of a column or row. Below creates three columns 200px wide <br>
          <img src="Images/Three tracks.jpg" alt=""><br>
          <img src="Images/Three tracks browser.jpg" alt=""></li>
        <li>Grid rows - you use <b style="color: red;">grid-template-rows</b> to set the rows in a grid</li>
        <li>If you add more items to the html the grid-templates-columns will be followed everything going into three columns</li>
        <li>Add Gutters Between Rows and Columns - CSS Grid gives you control over the spaces (or gutters) between columns and rows. You separate grid tracks using the grid-row-gap and grid-column-gap properties. <br>
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-row-gap" target="_blank">grid-row-gap - MDN</a>
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-column-gap" target="_blank">grid-column-gap - MDN</a>
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-gap" target="_blank">grid-gap - MDN</a></li>
        <li>To create a gutter in the grid you can use <b style="color: red;">grid-column-gap</b> and <b style="color: red;">grid-row-gap</b>. <br>
          This simply means you will get spacing between the columns and rows <br>
          <img src="Images/grid gutters css.jpg" alt=""> <br>
          <img src="Images/grid gutters browser.jpg" alt=""></li>
        <li>The short hand is <b style="color: red;">grid-gap:</b>. The first value is the row and the second is the column. One value is for both columns and rows</li>
        <li>for each column you need two lines so for column 1 you need lines 1 and 2. Same for rows. You can places items in particular boxes in the grid<br>
          <img src="Images/grid lines index.jpg" alt=""></li>
      </ul>
