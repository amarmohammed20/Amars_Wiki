          <h2>What is Object-Oriented JavaScript</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>This is more advanced JS, working mainly with objects that ties into a framework like react of angular</li>
                <li><b style="color: red;">Inherticance and Prototypes are not covered these need to be covered later</b></li>
                <li>A object is a package of information that you want to use in your code and its functions are called meathods, contains properties and functions</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-object-methods-in-javascript" target="_blank">meathods</a> are used to allow you to do something with your object </li>
                <li>The below exmaple is were the house is the object and the rest are its properties <br>
                <img src="Images/Object Example House.jpg" alt=""> <br>
                <img src="Images/Object Example Radio.jpg" alt=""></li>
                <li>Objects are a easy way to store data, used as containers. Another example of using a object as a storage container <br>
                <img src="Images/Object Example Containers.jpg" alt=""></li>
                <li>We have used objects before as they are like arrays and interarcting with the DOM. we use meathods to update and remove from an array of interact with the DOM</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

            <h2>Constructors & the 'this' Keyword</h2>
            <p>The JavaScript <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_this.asp" target="_blank">this</a> keyword refers to the object it belongs to.
              <br><img src="Images/js this.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <ul>
                <li>To create a object constructor you would do function Object() {}. Ensure to give the object a capital letter to start with and the internal will look like a object literal but using this. before each property
                  <br><img src="Images/Object Constructor Example.jpg" alt="">                </li>
                <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes" target="_blank">JavaScript classes</a>, introduced in ECMAScript 2015, are primarily syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance. The class syntax does not introduce a new object-oriented inheritance model to JavaScript.</li>
                <li>It is considered good practice to name constructor functions with an upper-case first letter.</li>
                <li>The difference between <a href="https://medium.com/@mandeepkaur1/object-literal-vs-constructor-in-javascript-df143296b816" target="_blank">object literals and object Constructors</a> boils down to if we need multiple instances of our object or not; object defined with a constructor let us have multiple instances of that object. Object literals are basically singletons with variables that are all public.
                <br><img src="Images/object literal and object constructor.png" alt=""> </li>
                <li>Object literals have key value pairs, fine to deal with one object but not multiple. 
                  <br><img src="Images/Object literal 2.jpg" alt=""></li>
                <li>Object Constructors/function deal with multiple instances. You always start with a capital. this. is a associated property to that object   </li>
                <li>You can create a new object using the new keyword</li>
                <li>To add a property to a object outside of the object you would do object.NEWPROPERTY = '';</li>
                <li>If you use this. outside of the function scope which is the Global scope you will get the windows object. Mainly used in the function scope</li>
                <li>You can build a function inside a object. The below example shows a function being used in a object to get the age. This calls the this birthday which is another property associated to the object 
                  <br><img src="Images/object function example.jpg" alt=""></li>
                <li>In a object you dont have to use the new keyword for the math object.</li>
              </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Built In Constructors</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>You can create a string in two ways. You wouldnt create a string as a object as the string will be classed as a object not a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive" target="_blank">primative value.</a> This would result in the === not working but the == would work if string is compared to another string. 
                  <br><img src="Images/string as object and normal .jpg" alt=""></li>
                <li>Th same applys to numbers, booleans, arrays, objects literals, regular expressions and functions as above.</li>
                <li><img src="Images/built in constructors.jpg" alt=""></li>
                <li>Proceed as you would normally instead of using the new method as explained above.</li>
              </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Prototypes Explained</h2>
            <p>All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_prototypes.asp" target="_blank">prototype</a>.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Date objects inherit from Date.prototype</li>
                    <li>Array objects inherit from Array.prototype</li>
                    <li>Person objects inherit from Person.prototype</li>
                    <li>The Object.prototype is on the top of the prototype inheritance chain: Date objects, Array objects, and Person objects inherit from Object.prototype.</li>
                  </ul>
                <li>The proto type against a object will be displays __proto__:object. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto" target="_blank">__proto__</a> property of Object.prototype is an accessor property (a getter function and a setter function) that exposes the internal [[Prototype]] (either an object or null) of the object through which it is accessed.
                  <br><img src="Images/proto property.jpg" alt=""></li>
                <li>Properties that can change within the object should not be in the prototype and things that dont change like a calcualtion for the age of someone will need to be place into the prototype</li>
                <li>To place something into the prototype of a object you do object.prototype.property = ;. This could be a function of a string or what ever you like.
                  <br><img src="Images/proto Example.jpg" alt=""></li>
                <li>When you console log the object the property that is placed into the prototype wont be seen but will be under __proto__</li>
                <li>You can manipulate the properties in prototype. This will only work if you reference a property from the object and this property is later changed or reassigned.</li>
                <li>WHY USE A PROTOTYPE?</li>
              </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Prototypal Inheritance</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>This is were one objects inherits the prototypes of another object</li>
                <li>You can use <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_call.asp" target="_blank">.call</a> to call another function within another function.
                  <br><img src="Images/call method.jpg" alt=""></li>
                <li>Call is used in the first part of inheritance in a object constructor which will have the first paramter as this, and than any paramters that are used in the object it is inherting. 
                  <br><img src="Images/call method inheritance.jpg" alt=""></li>
                <li>For inheritance we use object.prototype = Object.create(object.prototype);. This returns the inherited object against __proto__ and we want the current object to be displayed. To change this we use Object.proptotype.constructor = Customer;
                  <br>What this does it uses __proto__ and pulls in the associated properties into the new object constructor</li>
                <li>You can override or create new prototypes that have been inherited. This doesnt override the prototype that you have inheritied.</li>
                </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Using Object.create</h2>
            <p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create" target="_blank">Object.create()</a> method creates a new object, using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>When using the object.create you can create a variable and use Object.create(EXISTING_OBJECT). In the existing project you dont have to add any properties or pramaters to the function as this will be done later. You than specify the properties doing object(variable name).property = '';. 
                  <br><img src="Images/object create example.jpg" alt=""></li>
                <li>You can also achieve the above using the syntax below:
                  <br><img src="Images/object create example 2.jpg" alt=""></li>
              </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>ES6 Classes</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_classes.asp" target="_blank">Classes</a> is based on the above Object Constructors. The class concept is used in other lanuages such as C sharp, php, phython and Java and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Class-based_programming_languages" target="_blank">so on</a></p>
              <ul>
                <li>This is built with the structure class, constructor method and properties.</li>
                <li>A class always starts with a cpatial letter</li>
                <li>Pass the properties into the class as paramters and than define the properties with this.property.</li>
                <li>An example of a class - 
                  <br><img src="Images/Class Example.jpg" alt=""></li>
                <li>You will see this works exactly the same as the earlier explained object constructor. This can be seen in the __proto__ property of the object</li>
                <li>This is why we call class syntaxtic sugar as its only the syntax is different not the fundementals</li>
                <li>A method can be called and will be inserted in the constructor {}</li>
                <li><img src="Images/Class Example 2.jpg" alt=""></li>
                <li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/static" target="_blank">static</a> keyword defines a static method for a class. Static methods aren't called on instances of the class. Instead, they're called on the class itself. These are often utility functions, such as functions to create or clone objects.</li>
              </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Sub Classes</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>A sub class is used to extend a class. You would have a person class and you would extend this class with a customer class.</li>
                <li>To do this you would do class NEW_CLASS extends CURRENT_CLASS {}</li>
                <li>The new class would take in the same paramters and new paramters. This only extends one way</li>
                <li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/super" target="_blank">super</a> keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent. The super.prop and super[expr] expressions are valid in any method definition in both classes and object literals.</li>
                <li>Super replaces the object.prototype = Object.create(object.prototype); and Object.proptotype.constructor = Customer; used earlier for inhertiance. </li>
                <li><img src="Images/Class example inheritance.jpg" alt=""></li>

    <h2>Getters and Setters</h2>
      <p>Create properties with dynamic values using getters in JavaScript</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date" target="_blank">JavaScript Date Object</a> - Universal Time is not your current, local time. It's a global time standard based on the earth's rotation. The local time where you live is converted from Universal Time. <br> In JavaScript, you may have to make conversions from UTC to local time. </li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get" target="_blank">Getters</a> & <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set" target="_blank">Setter</a> are both methods enabling you to update create or retrieve object properties.</li>
        <li>We can update properties in objects through .notation as well as through using methods like setters and getters</li>
        <li>Getters and setters allow you to use logic when updating properties within a object</li>
        <li>Getter methods are used to dynamically create and retrieve a property method.</li>
        <li>Getter example - <b style="color: red;">get activity() {}</b>. Activity is the name of the function which is used to add a property to a class. In this get I will be using a if statement to decide what the value of the new property should be. <br>
          The below example shows a new property being added inside the constructor of the class which a javascript new.Date()(Brings back the date) and .getHours()(Brings back the hour of the day) <br>
          <img src="Images/Getter example.jpg" alt=""></li>
        <li>The Getter method never attaches the property but can be accessed when requested.</li>
        <li>The setter syntax is as - <b style="color: red;">set owner() {}</b>. This is creating a new property in the class for the object</li>
        <li>A setter method is used when you need to: Add logic when updating a property value.</li>
        <li>A setter always recieves one parameter when called </li>
        <li style="color: red;"> The name of a property can never be the same as a Getter or Setter</li>
        <li>To apply a value to the new property for the setter you - <b style="color: red;">ernie.owner= 'Ashley';</b>. Ernie is the class, owner is the new property and Ashley is the value </li>
        <li><img src="Images/Setter example.jpg" alt=""> <br>
          The above returned undefined. This is because we have to create a Getter for _owner <br>
          <img src="Images/Setter example 2.jpg" alt=""></li>
        <li>See excercise for <a href="Excercises/getter setter excercise.js">Getter and Setter</a></li>
        <li>A objects property can be another object, below is the new class to be used as a porperty for another object. The setter used is to ensure the phone number doesnt have any spaces or special charecters <br>
          <img src="Images/class for a property in a object.jpg" alt=""> <br>
          below is the new class being added to the object ernie with the parameters passed to it <br>

    <h2>Object-Oriented JavaScript Challange</h2>
    <p>Building a fun and interactive 'Four in a Row' game</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In app design What's important is not focusing on the "best" way to do something, but instead focusing on developing a codebase that is planned, logical, organized, documented, and tested.</li>
        <li>JavaScript objects can be a way to help us model real-life objects, or they can be used to provide structure and organization to real-life concepts and ideas.</li>
        <li>When we build our Four in a Row game, we'll be modeling all of its parts, pieces, and concepts with JavaScript objects. <br>
          <img src="Images/Four in a row game planning.jpg" alt=""></li>
        <li>This game has two things to start with - players and a board. <br>
          We also have tokens that are one of two colours and the board has spaces were these tokens go</li>
        <li>The below is a class that can be created to hold the core information for the game <br>
          <img src="Images/Four in a row game class planning.jpg" alt=""></li>
        <li>A player can have a colour or a name to identify whos turn it is of who won or is winning</li>
        <li>A token moving left, right, or dropping into a space is an example of an object behavior</li>
        <li>Score is not a class or object in Four in a Row. This game doesn't keep score, and if it did, the score would probably be managed in the Game class.</li>
        <li>It is normal to rewrtie a class and its constrcutor method many times</li>
        <li>Creator methods are used to routinely create several objects at once in a way that's organised and neat</li>
      </ul> -->
