            <h2>Error Handling, Try Catch Block</h2>
            <p>Errors Will Happen! When executing JavaScript code, different errors can occur. Errors can be coding errors made by the programmer, errors due to wrong input, and other unforeseeable things.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The try statement lets you test a block of code for errors. This could be a basic function or more complex code</li>
                <li>The catch statement lets you handle the error. For catch you pass in a parameter of your choice and call on that paramter and its properties. Properties like message, name, instanceof TypeError and many more </li>
                <li>try and catch work toghther and can handle errors without stopping the script</li>
                <li>The below example shows that you can catch a error while the script continuing
                  <br><img src="Images/try catch example 1.jpg" alt=""></li>
                <li>You can get the catch error to say what ever you want</li>
                <li>Finally can be added at the end and this ensures that the block of code in finally runs</li>
                <li>The throw statement lets you create custom errors. You could say something like if something is not equal to something throw error which could be custom.</li>
              </ul>

            <h2>Regular Expressions</h2>
            <p>A  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_regexp.asp" target="_blank">regular expression</a> is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. The search pattern can be used for text search and text replace operations. </p>

<h2>Exploring Async/Await</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Async await is the new way jaavscript deals with promises. no .than required<br>

        <li>Async await explination <br>
          <img src="Images/await details for async.jpg" alt=""></li>
        <li>An async function always returns a promise <br>
          That promise resolves with the value returned by the async function, or rejects with an error thrown from within the function</li>
        <li>Async/await is not meant to replace promises -- it's actually syntactic sugar for creating functions that return and wait for promises.</li>
        <li>the most common way to catch errors <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BztW_u6HDbs" target="_blank">try / catch with Promises</a></li>
