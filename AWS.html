                        <h2>Introduction to the AWS Cloud</h2>
                        <p>Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the    user. The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Before cloud computing we had data centers with infrastrucures that were over or under speced with no room of real flexibility.</li>
                                <li>Cloud computing enables us to use the required computing power from a data center that is scalable</li>
                                <li>These cloud resources are temporary and disposable if needed and can be created or powered up in seconds</li>
                                <li>Providing a more agile approach to IT infrastructure</li>
                                <li>Allowing businesses to react elastically and quickly to changing requirements or conditions</li>
                                <li>Agility is provided through increased speed, ease of experementation and pushing people to innovate</li>
                                <li>AWS is all over the world giving you a global reach in seconds</li>
                                <li>Very good for demo or test environments giving you the ability to create or changer server in seconds</li>
                                <li>Template based environment making it quick and easy to create servers or environments</li>
                                <li>Cloud Elasticity. Elasticity is the ability to grow or shrink infrastructure resources dynamically as needed to adapt to workload changes in an autonomic manner, maximizing the use of resources.</li>
                                <li>Amazon Web Services provides services and infrastructure to build reliable, fault-tolerant, and highly available systems in the cloud.</li>
                                <li>Fault-tolerance defines the ability for a system to remain in operation even if some of the components used to build the system fail.</li>
                                <li>The customer choses the location of the data and what level/type of encryption and were the necryption keys are kept.</li>
                                <li>Your security policy can be built into your infrastructure from the get go</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>AWS Interfaces</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>There are three ways to access AWS, Managment console, AWS CLI Command Line Interface and SDK's software Development Kits</li>
                                    <li>An SDK is a collection of software used for developing applications for a specific device or operating system. Examples of SDKs include the Windows 7 SDK, the Mac OS X SDK, and the iPhone SDK</li>
                                    <li>All the above three are built on a common interface/api that serves as the foundation for AWS</li>
                                    <li><img src="Images/AWS Interfaces.png" alt=""></li>
                                    <li>AWS Managment Console can be seen through the browser or the AWS APP</li>

                        <h2>AWS Core Services</h2>
                        <p>This module provide high level information about several AWS Cloud services, including Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2), Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS), Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), the AWS Global Infrastructure, Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and Security Groups.</p>

                            <h3>AWS Elastic Cloud Compute EC2</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.</li>
                                    <li><img src="Images/EC2.png" alt=""></li>
                                    <li>All resources are hosted in the cloud</li>
                                    <li>Elastic means if properly configured you can increase or decrease the resources required</li>
                                    <li><img src="Images/EC2 2.png" alt=""></li>
                                    <li>Steps to building a EC2 Instance
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Start of by chosing the region of were you want the instance to be hosted</li>
                                            <li>When starting out creating a EC2 instance you are required to chose a software layer to the instance, a AMI Amazon Machine Image. You can chose from the normal Windows or Linux or even chose a third party platform from the amazon market place</li>
                                            <li>Next you can chose the hardware selection called Instance Types, vCPUs, RAM, Sotrage and so on. <b style="color: red;"> You will find the lowest spec will be free for a year</b></li>
                                            <li>Next you configure the network and you would normally stick with the default. </li>
                                            <li>Next you add storage and the type of storage which is normally SSD</li>
                                            <li>At this point you can also add a tag. An example of a tag would be <b>key = NAME value = Webserver</b>. Tagging is helpful as you grow your infrastructure on AWS. Tags are fundementally meta data asaist a instance which can be shared across other instances. Key can be names, department, project, cost centre and so on</li>
                                            <li>Time to configure a security group, these are a set of firewalls rules in firewalls. You can add a rule for HTTP which is going to give your instance web connectivty.</li>
                                            <li>You are now done and can now launch the instance</li>
                                            <li>To connect to this instance using SSH you will need the private key file which is called a key pair. You will always want to create a new key pair when starting out with a new instance. You will than download the private key. <b style="color: red;">Keep this safe as it is essential when connecting using connecting over SSH</b></li>
                                            <li>It will take sometime to get running. In the admin console once the state is running you can than login</li>
                                            <li>To connect to the instance you will see detials against the instance in the console. Yo uwill need the public DNS and Public IP
                                                <br><img src="Images/Pub IP EC2.png" alt=""></li>
                                            <li>You will need to download <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html" target="_blank">puTTY</a>. The puTTY application is used to create a secure connection using SSH
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>Host Name is <b>ec2-user@PUBLIC DNS</b>. The public DNS can be found against the instance in the management console.</li>
                                                    <li>Next click ssh in the left hand menu in putty and select auth. Were Private key file authentication is located click browse and select the downloaded key pair created.
                                                    <br><img src="Images/Putty.png" alt=""></li>
                                                    <li>Putty on Windows requires a PPK file so we will have to use the Putty Gen tool. The tool creates the required ppk files 
                                                        <br><img src="Images/Pytty PPK File.jpg" alt=""></li>
                                                </ul></li>
                                            <li>With this new ppk file you should be able to log into the server you have created.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>High availability replicated across multiple servers in the area zone</li>
                                    <li>You can also create point in time snapshots of your volumes. You can use snapshots to create new machines in your current or other region zones</li>
                                    <li>Encryption occurs on the EC2 side and this is free.</li>
                                    <li>To create a volume you simply perform the follwing:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>In the AWS management console you navigate to EC2 and this is were you will find on the left under <b>Elastic Block Store</b> volumes
                                            <br><img src="Images/Volumes.png" alt=""></li>
                                            <li>If I want to attach a EBS volume to my EC2 instance the volume has to be created in the same Avalibilty Zone</li>
                                            <li>Create a volume and start by chosing the correct availability zone</li>
                                            <li>Select the required volume type SSD being the prefered but magnetic being the cheapest</li>
                                            <li>Select the size of the volume you would like to create</li>
                                            <li>Under snapshot ID you can restore a snapshot to a volume.</li>
                                            <li>Once the volume is created you will be given a Volume ID, take note of this ID

                                    <li>AWS S3 stands for Simple Sotrage Services</li>
                                    <li>Data stored in a s3 bucket isnt associated to any perticular server and doesnt have to be managed</li>
                                    <li>Can hold any object type, even large database backups.</li>
                                    <li>By default data is not shown publicly</li>
                                    <li><img src="Images/AWS S3.png" alt=""></li>
                                    <li>In S3 you create a bucket that will hold your data. When placing a item in a bucket you will need a key, something we use later to get the item back later.
                                        <br><img src="Images/AWS S3 Bucket.png" alt=""></li>

                                    <li>Avalibilty Zones are a physically distint independent infrastructure, they are physically and logically seperate.</li>
                                    <li>A Edge location is datacenter owned by a trusted partner of AWS which has a direct connection to the AWS network</li>
                                    <li>These Edge locations are used to serve requests from services like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/" target="_blank">Cloud Front</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/" target="_blank">Route 53</a></li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.</li>

                                    <li>In the image above you will see that the web tier is the only group that accepts traffic from the web. The app tier only accepts traffic from the Web Tier and so on. You will see that there is a SSH/RDP connection allowed from coporate to connect to any tier.</li>
                                    <li>To make a security group start of with navigating to the ec2 location in the admin center</li>

                        <h2>AWS Integrated Services</h2>
                        <p>This module focuses on some of the integrated services that are part of the AWS Cloud, including Application Load Balancer, Auto Scaling, Amazon Route 53, Amazon Relational Database Services (RDS), AWS Lambda, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon CloudFront, and AWS CloudFormation.</p>

                            <h3>Application Load Balancer</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>SOme info on a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html" target="_blank">Application Load Balancer</a></li>
                                    <li><img src="Images/Application load Balancer.png" alt=""></li>
                                    <li>A load balancer serves as the single point of contact for clients. The load balancer distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones. This increases the availability of your application. You add one or more listeners to your load balancer.
                                        <br><img src="Images/Application load Balancer 2.png" alt=""></li>
                                    <li>Adds a few more features to the classic load balancer</li>
                                    <li><img src="Images/Application load Balancer features.png" alt=""></li>

                                    <li>Another use case to see. We have rules against listners looking out for conditions you have set to route the traffic to the right target group

                                    <li>A added feature is path based routing were you can route the traffic of a user that has come to a particular url, driving the traffic exactly were you would like it</li>
                                    <li>A good guide to Setup a application load balancer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKnd03nxu3k" target="_blank">AWS - ALB</a> </li>
                                    <li>To build a application load balancer you will navigate to the ec2 screen in the admin portal and go to load balancer. Here you can create either a classic load balancer or a application load balancer.</li>
                                    <li>Once you have created the load balancer ensure to create the target group. Ensure to register the instance for that target group</li>
                                    <li></li>
