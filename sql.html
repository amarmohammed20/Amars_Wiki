        <li>Oracle divides a database into one or more logical storage units called <a href="https://www.oracletutorial.com/oracle-administration/oracle-tablespace/" target="_blank">tablespaces</a> <br>
          Each tablespace consists of one or more files called datafiles. A datafile physically stores the data objects of the database such as tables and indexes on disk. <br>
          In other words, Oracle logically stores data in the tablespaces and physically stores data in datafiles associated with the corresponding tablespaces. <br>
