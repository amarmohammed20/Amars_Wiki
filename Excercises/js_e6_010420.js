/* Important note 
The behavior of most browsers has changed since this video was shot, so you won't see the same thing as I demonstrate in the video. In the video, you'll see that my script is able to print out to the browser using document.write( ) while inside a loop.

Most browsers no longer do that: they wait until the loop finishes and then they print to the window. So, you'll see a blank page until you type quit in the prompt window â€” then you'll see all the output printed to the screen.

Sorry for the confusion, and we'll update the video soon. */
