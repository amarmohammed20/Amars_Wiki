    <h1> The Git page, recording all my notes in my git learning </h1>
    <h2>Day 1</h2>
    <p>The below is what I have learned on the first day</p>
      <ul>
        <li>git has stages on how it tracks a change for a file
            <ul>
                <li><b>"git add"</b> to add a file to the repository/staging area.</li> 
                <li>Once added you can commit <b>"git commit -m "comment"</b> which places the file in the commited area</li>
            </ul>
        <li>you can assign a name and email address to your user on git providing more information about you, useful to when other look at who made changes in the aduit of git</li>
            <ul>
                <li>My refference for this is <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration">Git Website</a>
                <li><b>git config --global user.name "John Doe"</b> - This changes the username</li>
                <li><b>git config --global user.email "am.inspiredsolutions@gmail.com"</b> - This changes the email address</li>
            <ul>
        <li>create a new repository through the command <b>"git init"</b>. We can now start to add file in this repository and keep track of there changes</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
      </ul>
