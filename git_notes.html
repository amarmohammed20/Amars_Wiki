    <h1> The Git page, recording all my notes in my git learning </h1>
    <h2>Usefull notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>q</b> is used to quit out of a command</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Day 1</h2>
    <p>The below is what I have learned on the first day</p>
      <ul>
        <li>git has stages on how it tracks a change for a file
            <ul>
                <li><b>"git add"</b> to add a file to the repository/staging area(stages for commit).</li> 
                <li>Once added you can commit <b>"git commit -m "comment"</b> which places the file in the commited area</li>
            </ul>
        <li>you can assign a name and email address to your user on git providing more information about you, useful to when other look at who made changes in the aduit of git</li>
            <ul>
                <li>My refference for this is <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration">Git Website</a>
                <li><b>git config --global user.name "John Doe"</b> - This changes the username</li>
                <li><b>git config --global user.email "am.inspiredsolutions@gmail.com"</b> - This changes the email address</li>
                <li><b>git config -l</b> - Enables you to check the username and email and other git information, to exit use "q".</li>
            <ul>
        <li>create a new repository through the command <b>"git init"</b>. We can now start to add file in this repository and keep track of there changes</li>
        <li>The <b>git diff</b>command Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc </li>
        <li>The command <b>git log</b> shows you a log of everything you have done in the commit stage.<br> This is why its important to to provide good comments when commiting in git</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Day 2</h2>
    <p>The below is what I have learned on the second day</p>
      <ul>
          <li><b>git rm</b> is used to remove a file in the git repository(only in the staging area). Example <i>git rm tins.html</i> - a html file saved in the repository. Now commit this change through a normal commit</li>
          <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-mv">Source Website</a>You can move or rename a file using <b>git mv "EXISITNG FILENAME" "NEW FILENAME"</b>. You will need to commit this change as currently you see <img src="C:\Users\SEISMI020\Desktop\Git Practice\git MV status.jpg" alt="git status of change not commited">. Commit your changes.</li>
          <li>To move a file from the staged stage to the modified stage use the command <b>git reset HEAD file name</b> Example <i>git reset HEAD headers.txt</i>. Image to display this <img src="C:\Users\SEISMI020\Desktop\Git Practice\git reset HEAD.jpg" alt="git reset">. <b>git status</b> does provide info about this </li>
          <li>Git cannot get back changes that have not been commited so anything in the modified or staging if removed/deleted will be removed forever. <br> the command for this is <b>git checkout -- FILENAME</b>. Image to display <img src="C:\Users\SEISMI020\Desktop\Git Practice\Git checkout --.jpg" alt="git checkout command"> </li>
          <li>When git status shows deletion of a file you can undo this by running the command <b>git checkout -- FILENAME</b> See image <img src="C:\Users\SEISMI020\Desktop\Git Practice\git undo delete.jpg" alt="git status enabling you to undo a delete"></li>
          <li>When running a <b>git log</b> command you see a long string of text and numbers called SHA (Simple Hashing Algorithm) <br>See image <img src="C:\Users\SEISMI020\Desktop\Git Practice\SHA.jpg" alt="git SHA (Simple Hashing Algorithm)"> <br> using the command git revert SHA enable to to revert back to that commited file in git. <b>git revert SHA</b>This can be the first 5 charecters of the SHA code <br>if you find that the revert you just did was wrong you can use the command to revert this revert <b>git revert HEAD</b>, HEAD meaning use the most recent SHA </li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Day 3</h2>
    <p>The below is what I have learned on the second day</p>
