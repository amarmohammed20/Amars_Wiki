    <h2>Usefull notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>q</b> is used to quit out of a command</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Day 1</h2>
    <p>The below is what I have learned on the first day</p>
      <ul>
        <li>git has stages on how it tracks a change for a file
            <ul>
                <li><b>"git add"</b> to add a file to the repository/staging area(stages for commit).</li> 
                <li>Once added you can commit <b>"git commit -m "comment"</b> which places the file in the commited area</li>
            </ul>
        <li>you can assign a name and email address to your user on git providing more information about you, useful to when other look at who made changes in the aduit of git</li>
            <ul>
                <li>My refference for this is <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration">Git Website</a>
                <li><b>git config --global user.name "John Doe"</b> - This changes the username</li>
                <li><b>git config --global user.email "am.inspiredsolutions@gmail.com"</b> - This changes the email address</li>
                <li><b>git config -l</b> - Enables you to check the username and email and other git information, to exit use "q".</li>
            <ul>
        <li>create a new repository through the command <b>"git init"</b>. We can now start to add file in this repository and keep track of there changes</li>
        <li>The <b>git diff</b>command Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc </li>
        <li>The command <b>git log</b> shows you a log of everything you have done in the commit stage.<br> This is why its important to to provide good comments when commiting in git</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Day 2</h2>
    <p>The below is what I have learned on the second day</p>
      <ul>
          <li><b>git rm</b> is used to remove a file in the git repository(only in the staging area). Example <i>git rm tins.html</i> - a html file saved in the repository. Now commit this change through a normal commit</li>
          <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-mv">Source Website</a>You can move or rename a file using <b>git mv "EXISITNG FILENAME" "NEW FILENAME"</b>. You will need to commit this change as currently you see <img src="C:\Users\SEISMI020\Desktop\Git Practice\git MV status.jpg" alt="git status of change not commited">. Commit your changes.</li>
          <li>To move a file from the staged stage to the modified stage use the command <b>git reset HEAD file name</b> Example <i>git reset HEAD headers.txt</i>. Image to display this <img src="C:\Users\SEISMI020\Desktop\Git Practice\git reset HEAD.jpg" alt="git reset">. <b>git status</b> does provide info about this </li>
          <li>Git cannot get back changes that have not been commited so anything in the modified or staging if removed/deleted will be removed forever. <br> the command for this is <b>git checkout -- FILENAME</b>. Image to display <img src="C:\Users\SEISMI020\Desktop\Git Practice\Git checkout --.jpg" alt="git checkout command"> </li>
          <li>When git status shows deletion of a file you can undo this by running the command <b>git checkout -- FILENAME</b> See image <img src="C:\Users\SEISMI020\Desktop\Git Practice\git undo delete.jpg" alt="git status enabling you to undo a delete"></li>
          <li>When running a <b>git log</b> command you see a long string of text and numbers called SHA (Simple Hashing Algorithm) <br>See image <img src="C:\Users\SEISMI020\Desktop\Git Practice\SHA.jpg" alt="git SHA (Simple Hashing Algorithm)"> <br> using the command git revert SHA enable to to revert back to that commited file in git. <b>git revert SHA</b>This can be the first 5 charecters of the SHA code <br>if you find that the revert you just did was wrong you can use the command to revert this revert <b>git revert HEAD</b>, HEAD meaning use the most recent SHA </li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Day 3</h2>
    <p>The below is what I have learned on the third day</p>
      <ul>
          <li>each developer has a local repo on thier own machine. Another developer is called a remote repo. <br> Both repos have full copies of the repository. You would normally pull from the other developers repo recieving all thier commits and that you can start adding to your new local repo.</li>
          <li>The better way to work is to have a central repo and people push commits to the repo. <br> <img src="C:\Users\SEISMI020\Desktop\Git Practice\central repo commit.jpg" alt="pushing a commit to a central repo">. <br> Other developers will pull from the central repo to work locally on thier local repo ready to than commit and push to the central repo <br> <img src="C:\Users\SEISMI020\Desktop\Git Practice\central repo commit pull.jpg" alt="pulling a commit from a central repo"></li>
          <li>To get started with pulling a repo you need to clone the repo. Get to the right directory. <br> command is <b>git clone DIRECTORY TARGETDIRECTORY</b> DONT USE SPACES IN YOUR DIRECTORY NAMES. The below is an example of cloning a local directory <br> <img src="C:\Users\SEISMI020\Desktop\Git Practice\Clone Test.jpg" alt="Test clone"> </li>
          <li>You can create a text file called <b>.igitignore</b> which allows to ignore file when cloning a repo <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/how-to-use-gitignore-file">A little info!</a> </li>
          <li>when you create a clone repo it automatically creates a link in the cloned repo called origin the command to check is <b>git remote</b> <br> You can pull changes from the original repo by using the command <b>git pull</b> on the command you dont have to state the remote name as this time you are pulling from the original repo  </li>
          <li>To add a remote to a repo to another repo so you can pull you use the comman <b>git remote add REMOTENAME URL</b>. <br> Example <img src="C:\Users\SEISMI020\Desktop\Git Practice\New Remote.jpg" alt="">. <br> when running a pull with the new remote we get a error asking us to state a branch <br> You can use the command which is <b>git pull REMOTENAME BRANCH</b> this example the default branch created is master </li>
          <li>when you work with other you can use a github repo. create a repo on your local machine and a empty repo in github. <br> create a remote on your machine and use the url for the empty repo in github, ready for you to push your commits up to the github repo. </li>
          <li>Once in git hub you can create a new repo ready for you to use when creating the new remote. <br> command being <b>git remote add REMOTENAME REPOURL</b> </li>
          <li>Perform a push to push the local repo to the git hub repo. command <b>git push REMOTENAME BRANCH</b> the defualt branch created is master <br> if you use -u in the command moving forward you wont have to specify a remote name or branch, command <b>git push -u REMOTENAME BRANCH</b></li>
      </ul>
     <p>Summary of the course</p>
