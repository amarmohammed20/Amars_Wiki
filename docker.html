            <h2>What is Docker?</h2>
              <p>Developing apps today requires so much more than writing code. Multiple languages, frameworks, architectures, and discontinuous interfaces between tools for each lifecycle stage creates enormous complexity. Docker simplifies and accelerates your workflow, while giving developers the freedom to innovate with their choice of tools, application stacks, and deployment environments for each project.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.</li>
                  <li>With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.</li>
                  <li>Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container.</li>
                  <li>Containers are lightweight because they don’t need the extra load of a hypervisor, but run directly within the host machine’s kernel.</li>
                  <li>This means you can run more containers on a given hardware combination than if you were using virtual machines.</li>
