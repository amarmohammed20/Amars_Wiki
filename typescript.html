            <h2>TypeScript Basics, What Is It?</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> is an open-source language which builds on JavaScript, one of the world’s most used tools, by adding static type definitions. Types provide a way to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation, and allowing TypeScript to validate that your code is working correctly.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>TypeScript is a lanuage that adds value to JavaScript by constructing your code in a manner that is always being checked for errors

                <li>A JavaScript <a href="https://medium.com/@daspinola/typescript-is-a-superset-of-javascript-meaning-its-a-layer-around-js-with-more-methods-and-that-46bbc9368be1" target="_blank">superset,</a> meaning it’s a layer around JS with more methods and that makes you follow a certain way of development that you don’t have to otherwise in vanilla (like having to set the types of your variables).</li>
                <li>Both the browser and node js cant excecute Typescript</li>
                <li>Typescript is a tool, a compiler that you run over your javascript code to create Typescript. Typescript will provide a easier way to do something while than is compiled to more complex Javascript code</li>
                <li>Typescript adds <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/typescript/typescript_types.htm" target="_blank">types</a> to javascript which is a feature.</li>

              <p>Example of were you might use TypeScript.
                <br><img src="Images/TypeScript Example.jpg" alt="">
                <br>Here you have a function were you return two numbers and console.log the two numbers added toghther. Using types in TypeScript you can ensure that both number returned from the functions are numbers and not strings.
                <br>This actually isnt a runtime error its a logical mistake as the numbers could be precieved as strings.
