    <h1> The Javascript page, recording all my notes in my Javascript learning </h1>
      <p>Some notes on Javascript providing a understanding.
      <br>Always use DRY when coding <b>Dont Repeat Yourself</b>
      <br>Built into the browser
      <br>Lots of tools to make life easier
      <br>Lots of data types <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp" target="_blank">Data Types</a>
      <br>You can write stright to the html using <b>document.getElementByID("output")</b>. There is a div in the html with the id output.
      <br>When working with numbers, strings, and booleans, you learned that you could not change (or manipulate) the value of a constant through reassignment. 
      <br>The same goes for any value of a constant variable. You cannot reassign objects and arrays, either.
      <br>To link a javascript file to a HTML file user <b style = "color:red">script src="" /script</b>. Include the brackets around.
      </p>
    <h2>Usefull notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>q</b> is used to quit out of a command</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Day 1</h2>
    <p>Javascript has three types of variables Const, Let and var</p>
      <ul>
          <li>To reassign a value in javascript you can use +=</li>
          <li>const variables - The value of the variable should remain constant. Once assigned a value you cant later down the code assign another value</li>
          <li>let variables lets you update the value of the variable but never reassign the value.</li>
          <li>var variables - You are able to assign a value to a variable at anytime, even when a variable has been assigned a value earlier on </li>
          <li>Javascript has the data type string, example "Hello world!"</li>
          <li>If you start a string with " end with ", can also use ' <br> How to decide on which one will determine what is in your string example if you use I'm than use "</li>
          <li>If you use a \ infront of a ' than javascript will treat this as a normal charector</li>
          <li>If you want to write a string on mutiple lines use a \ at the end of each line</li>
          <li>Javascript has many properties that make it easier to perform simple tasks <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_properties.asp" target="_blank"> Properties</a> <br> Example = passphrase.length give you the length of the variable passphrase <br> passphrase is a object and length is the property.</li>
          <li>A meathod is something you can do to a string <br> Example = toUpperCase()</li>
          <li><b>Properties are like nouns. They have a value or state. Methods are like verbs. They perform actions.</b></li>
          <li></li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Day 2</h2>
    <p>Start things of with a recap and than proceed</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Start things of with a challange to build a word game, Your gona ask for an adjective, verb and noun and than make a story out of this. <br> see javascript file for the game <a href="js_e1_260320.html" target="_blank">JS_E1_260320</a></li>
      <h3>Conditional Statements</h3>
         <li>An example of a conditional formatting is were in the previous excercise you asked for a name, the condition can be that it has to be a string</li>
         <li>example of this would be the code <br>
        const answer = prompt('which planet is closet to the sun?'); <br>
        if (answer.toUpperCase === 'MERCURY') { <br>
          console.log("That's Correct"); <br>
        } else { <br>
             console.log("thats incorrect"); <br>
             } <br>
         --- You can add a .toUpperCase to answer in the if statement ensuring that answer inserted is always in capitals <br>
          </li>
        <h3>Comparison Operators</h3>
          <li>Here are just some comparison Operators Comparison <br> <img src="images/Operators.jpg" alt=""> </li>
          <li>In Javascript when using the comparison's, Javascript reacts true and false.</li>
          <li>Booleans return true or false. All conditions returna true or false value. true and false are not strings no '' <br>
          <img src="images/boolean example.jpg" alt=""></li>
          <li>you can also use a else if in a if statement. You only use else if if the first else is false.</li>
          <li>add two conditions to a if statement <br>
          && means something and something <br></li>
          <li>When using the or operator <b>||</b> you have to have full conditions on both sides</li>
          <li>Document your code - Consider other developers. <br> To leave a comment use <b>//</b> or multi line comment <b>/* */</b> or in line - after code <b>//</b> <br>
          Use comments when you are doing something complex <br>
          You can also comment out code</li>
          <li>A challange to build a quiz game, ask 5 questions and depending on the score you get a trophy <br> see javascript file for the game <a href="js_e2_260320.html">JS_E2_260320</a></li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Day 3</h2>
      <p>Javascript Numbers</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Data types for javascript: <br>
            Strings - series of number and letters enclosed in ""
            Boolean - is either is true of false
            Numbers - Numeric data types, counting and calculating</li>
          <li>a Interger is a whole number, either positive or negative number. It has no decimal places </li>
          <li>Floating point numbers are used to represent fractional values and include a decimal point.</li>
          <li>This is an integer value -- scientific notation uses the letter 'e' to represent an exponential value.</li>
          <p>Developers frequently use numbers for performing calculations; you'll likely spend a lot of time working with numbers in JavaScript. If you create a game, for example, you'll need to keep track of a player's score. If you build an eCommerce site, you'll need to figure out the total cost of items in a visitor's shopping cart. And if you want to calculate the number of days until your next birthday, you'll need to use numbers and do some math.</p>
          <li>Arithmetic Operators - JavaScript lets you perform most mathematical calculations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</li>
          <li>There are shorthand methods for performing each of the basic mathematical operations on a variable: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. For example, to add 10 to the contents of a variable, use += 10. This both adds 10 to the current variable and assigns the result back into the variable. <br>
          There are also shorthands for subtracting from a variable, multiplying a variable by a value, and dividing a variable by a value. <br>
          <img src="images/short hand.jpg" alt=""></li>
          <li>Time excercise <a href="js_e3_270320.html" target="_blank">js_e3_270320</a></li>
          <li>When a user inputs a number javascript treats this like a string, example a webform.</li>
          <li>You can use <b>typeof</b> before the variable so it displays if it is a string</li>
          <li>To convert a string to a number you can use <b>parseInt</b> <br>
            Example <b>const fruit = parseInt(melons) + parseInt(oranges);</b>
            Melons and orange have been given numbers by the user through a propmt</li>
          <li><b>parseFloat</b> is like the above but for decimal numbers</li>
          <li>For the above parseInt and parseFloat you can just use + before the variable and does the same thing. </li>
          <p>Random Numbers</p>
          <li>Javascript treats strings, numbers and booleans as objects, a object is a wrap around that data type</li>
          <li>Javascript objects have many properties example is <b>object.length</b></li>
          <li>Javascript objects have many meathods example is <b>object.toUppercase()</b></li>
          <li> <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math" target="_blank">Math Object</a> Meathods and Properties </li>
          <li>Example of a math meathod <b>Math.round(2.2)</b> this rounds the number up</li>
          <li>Create a random number using Javascript <b>Math.random()</b> This returns a decimal place number between 0 and 1 but never 1</li>
          <li>To get Math.random() to return a random number between 1 and 6 you do <b>Math.random() * 6;</b></li>
          <li>Math.floor() rounds the number down and Math.ceil() rounds the number up <br>
            Both pass the whole number if the number is not a decimal place</li>
          <li>Example of the two above <b>Math.floor( Math.random() * 6 )</b> This gives me a whole number between 0 and 5</li>
          <li>To have the above to give me a number between one and 6 I do <b>Math.floor( Math.random() * 6 ) + 1;</b></li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Day 4</h2>
       <p>Continue Javascript Numbers</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Example of rounding to the nearest interger for a variable. <b>const tempRounded = Math.round(temperature);</b></li>
          <li>Excercise <a href="js_e4_280320.html" target="_blank">JS_E4_280320</a></li>
          <li>In the excercise above if the user did not put a number in you would get NaN, stands for not a number.</li>
          <li>To deal with the above issue of no input from a user use a condition <b>if statement</b> </li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Javascript Functions help in video <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjAu2Y2nJ34" target="_blank">Dev Ed</a></h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Functions are a repetable set of insturctions you can over and over again</li>
              <li>You setup your function and than you can call it when ever you like</li>
              <li>Decalre a fuction <br>
              <b>function goToCoffeeShop() { <br>
                 <br>
                  }</b></li>
              <li>A function name cant have spaces or start with a number but you can use letters and number and dollar sign</li>
              <li>The () after a function are called parentheses</li>
              <li>Remember to close the syntax and call the function code <b>FUNCTIONNAME();</b> </li>
              <li>Math.floor() and Math.random() are also function as they have (), these are built in functions</li>
              <li>Example of a function <br>
              <img src="images/Function Example.jpg" alt=""></li>
              <li>A function can return a value, this can be used in a alert or variable Example <br>
              <img src="images/Function%20return%20value.jpg" alt=""></li>
              <li>To return a value from a function use <b>return</b> in the function <br>
              Example <b>return random number</b>, random number being a variable <br>
              When I call this value from the function I still use () example <b>console.log( getRandomNumber () ); </b></li>
              <li>The below image is an exmaple of a function that looks in the html for a value in the Info ID <br>
                  <img src="images/Function%20with%20condition.jpg" alt=""></li>
              <li>A return in a function can only return one thing</li>
          <p>Passing information into a function</p>
            <li>You can send information into a function, these are called arguments. <br>
                You have to add a parameter into the function example <b>function goToCoffeeShop(drink)</b>. Parameter being drink</li>
            <li>Example below - You are using the parameter drink and the alert give a message using that parameter. When calling the function you give that drink parameter a value Iced Tea.<br>
                <img src="images/pass%20param%20function.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>Another example - Upper is the parameter and this determines what the max random number can be. We pass many different numbers through the function<br>
                <img src="images/pass%20param%20function%202.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>You can pass more than one paramter into a function, see exmaple below <br>
                <img src="images/pass%202%20param%20to%20function.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>Its not neat to pass to many arguments into a function, you can use something like an array</li>
            <li>Variables created in a function and they dont interact with any variable outside that function</li>
            <li>variables outside of a function are part of the global scope. Variables in the function and global scope dont interact.<br>
              <img src="images/variable%20functions.jpg" alt=""></li>
         <p>Function Declarations Vs. Function Expressions</p>
            <li>An anonymous function is a function without a name after the function keyword. Dont forget to add a ; after the closing } as it is a variable example <br>
              <img src="images/anonymous%20function%20example.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>The JavaScript engine moves function declarations to the top of their scope before code execution. This behavior is called: hoisting</li>
            <li>Function declarations load before any other code is loaded. See example <br>
              <img src="images/function%20dec%20loading%20first%20example.jpg" alt=""> </li>
            <li>Function expressions dont work like function declarations. The code runs from the top down and errors if the wrong way
              <img src="images/error%20for%20function%20expression%20example.jpg" alt=""> <br>
              <img src="images/error%20for%20function%20expression.jpg" alt=""> <br>
                The right layout <br>
                <img src="images/correct%20function%20expression%20example.jpg" alt=""> </li>
            <li>Summary for function declaration and fuction expression <br>
              <b>Function Decalration</b> <br> <img src="images/function%20dec.jpg" alt=""> <br>
              <b>Function Expression</b> <br> <img src="images/Function%20expression.jpg" alt=""></li>
         <p>Arrow Functions</p>
            <li>Arrow function expressions - Here you remove the function word in a function expression and add <b>=></b> after the () <br>
              <img src="images/arrow%20function%20example.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>First change a function declaration to a function expression, putting the function in a varaible <br>
              Than remove the word function after the const/let variable and add => after the paranthasis () <br>
              <img src="images/arrow%20function%20example%202.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>Example of arrow function without return and {} while returning a value - <img src="images/another%20arrow%20function.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>Arrow functions are anonymous as they dont have a name and you call or referrence the function using the variable name</li>
            <li>Arrow functions are not hosted to the top of the code, they are only ran when the code reaches them</li>
            <li>Arrow functions are not meant to replace function decalaration or expressions just newer syntax</li>
            <li>Example one parameter - <img src="images/arrow%201%20param.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>Example multiple parameter - <img src="images/arrow%20multiple%20param.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>Example arrow function one line statement - <img src="images/arrow%20one%20line%20statement.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>Single-line Functions with No Parameters - <img src="images/single%20line%20function%20with%20no%20params.jpg" alt=""> </li>
            <li>If a paramter isnt passed to a function you will get <b>undefined!</b>. Means there is no value</li>
            <li>To assign a default value to for your paramter for the function - <b>function sayGreeting(name = "student")</b>
              <img src="images/Defualt%20value%20function%20param.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>If you have placed mutiple defualt value for multiple parameters and you want to define only one paramter use undefined to blank out the other paramters.</li>
            <li>There is a standard syntax you can use to document functions -- it's known as <a href = "https://jsdoc.app/index.html">JSDoc</a>, and the format looks like this:</li>
            <li><img src="images/Javascript%20commenting.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li><img src="images/Javascript%20commenting%202.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>The Power of JSDoc - <br>
                Besides its descriptive format, the JSDoc tool itself has other useful and powerful features. JSDoc is also a documentation generator for JavaScript. <br>
                For example, when you add documentation comments directly to your source code, JSDoc can scan your code and generate an HTML documentation website for you. However, you'll need to install special tools to run this feature -- you'll learn about some of these tools later in your JavaScript learning journey.</li>
            <li><b>isNaN()</b> can be used to check if a value is a number, normally in a if statement. It returns a boolean value true or false.</li>
            <li><b>throw Error</b> can be used instead of console.log to print a custom error to the console log. <br>
              <img src="images/Throw%20error%20example.jpg" alt=""></li>          
        </ul>
      <h2>Javascript Arrays, Loops and Objects</h2>
        <p>Simplify Repetitive Tasks with Loops</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Loops enable you to repeat a task, like multiple random number or mutiple questions until you get the right answer</li>
            <li>Arrays enable you collect a lot of information in one place, like a list of 100 random numbers</li>
            <li>A loop repeats a certain number of actions a certain number of times or until a certain condition is true</li>
          <p>While Loops - a loop that runs until the condition is no longer true</p>
            <li>An example of a while loop - Below is the exmaple explained <br>
                The variable counter is 0 and counts the time the while loop is ran
                The condition in the while loop is keep running until you get to 100. <b>counter less than 100</b><br>
                so the function is ran and everytime it runs it adds one to the variable counter <b>counter += 1;</b>
                <img src="images/Example%20of%20a%20while%20Loop.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>Another example of a while loop with a condition using a function <br>
                <img src="images/Example%20of%20a%20while%20Loop%202.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>A while loop complex example <br>
                <img src="images/A%20while%20loop%20complex%20example.jpg" alt=""> <br>
                <img src="images/A%20while%20loop%20complex%20example%20code.jpg" alt=""> <br>
                <img src="images/A%20while%20loop%20complex%20example%20front%20end%20result.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>The while loop condition has to be true for the loop to run</li>
            <li>Something has to happen in the loop for it to stop running, normally the loop updates a variable that breaks the condition</li>
          <p>Do while loop - like the while loop but will always run the code block once as the condition is after the code block<br>
            Good to be used to collect a users email address. The loop would run wihtout checking any conditions and than keep running until it has a valid email address <br>
            <img src="images/do%20while%20loop.jpg" alt=""></p>
            <li>Below is a example of a do while. It asks a users to insert a number and keep going until the user get the right random number recording the number of tried <br>
                <img src="images/do%20while%20loop%20example.jpg" alt=""></li>
          <p>For loop - Normally used to run a particular numbe rof times, most parts simliar to a while and do while loop</p>
            <li>Normally used when looking through an array.</li>
            <li>for loop vs while loop example <br>
                <img src="images/while%20loop%20vs%20for%20loop.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>The for loop is normally written like below, also in my previous experience you use <b>i</b> <br>
                <img src="images/for%20loop%20using%20i.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>In the example below you have a variable that is updated everytime the loop is ran. the for loop is structured through: <br>
                assigning a value to i <br>
                setting a condition, i has to be less than or equal to 10 <br>
                and everytime the loop is ran 1 is added to i through += <br>
                Thank inside the {} a update is performed dynamically updating the variable outside the loop <br>
                Finally the variable outside the loop is written to the page <br>
                <img src="images/i%20loop%20example.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>Another example were you have to log every number from 4 to 156 in the console log <br>
                <img src="images/i%20loop%20example%202.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>Exit condition on a loop - when something is no longer true. <br>
                You can also use a break statement, example below were the while condition is always true but the break will stop the loop after the right answer<br>
                <img src="images/break%20example.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>The below example is were we want the user to guess the random number in 10 guesses also capturing if they gues sit right before <br>
                <img src="images/10%20guess%20example.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li><b>In for loops try to use let when defining the variable i</b></li>

        <ul>
            <li>A variable is a simple array it holds one bit of data</li>
            <li>An array can hold strings, number or any sort of data types</li>
            <li>You can add an remove from an array as you go along.</li>
            <li>Example of an array <b>var shopping = ["milk", 2, "Hello"];</b></li>
                <img src="images/basic%20array.jpg" alt="">
            <li>To print a array its like printing a variable becuas eit is a variable</li>
            <li>To call a item within an array you use index. <b>The first item in the array is 0</b></li>
            <li>Example of calling out an itme in an array <br>
                <img src="images/Calling%20item%20in%20array.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>If you call a item for example [4] and there are only three items in an array you will return undefined</li>
            <li>You can use properties to find details for your array. example <b>numbers.length</b>. Numbers being an array variable</li>
            <li>You can add a anohter value to a 6 value array. <b>numbers[ numbers.length ] = 7;</b></li>
            <li>You can add a value to an array using a push meathod. <b>numbers.push(8, 9);</b>. numbers being the array and the array having 7 values inside</li>
            <li>You can add a value to the start of an array using a unshift meathod. <b>numbers.unshift( 0 );</b>.</li>
            <li>To print an array in javascript you can use <b>printList( playList );</b>. Playlist being the array variable</li>
            <li>To remove the first value from an array you use the command <b>numbers.shift();</b> <br>
              .shift also retrieves the first item in the array and you can save this in a variable - Example <b>var lastItem = numbers.shift();</b></li>
            <li>To remove the last value from an array you use the command <b>numbers.pop();</b> <br>
              .pop also retrieves the last item in the array and you can save this in a variable - Example <b>var lastItem = numbers.pop();</b></li>
            <li>Example of a array and for loop working toghther <br>
              <img src="images/Example of for loop and array.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>The join meathod is used with an array, enabling you to display all the value in one go from the array. 
              Exmaple is <b>var daysString = daysInWeek.join(",");</b>. This says use , to join all the values in the array <br>
              <img src="images/join for an array.jpg" alt=""> </li>
            <li>The concat meathod is used with multiple arrays, enabling you to joing different arrays toghther. 
              Exmaple is <b> var allStudents = currentStudents.concat( newStudents );</b>. This says concat the currentStudents array with the newStudents array. <br>
              The arrays still exisit as they stand but concat simply makes a new variable with them both in <br>
              <img src="images/concat for an array.jpg" alt=""> </li>
            <li>You can use the meathod indexOf for an array to tell you the position of a item in the array <br>
              Example - <b>var position = fruit.indexOf("Apple");</b>. The result for the variable would be 0 as Apple is first in the array <br>
              <img src="images/indexOf for an array.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>For the indexOf meathod if you as for the position of a item that isnt in the array you get back <b>-1</b></li>
            <li>To check for something in an array you can use <b>if (inStock.includes(search) === true)</b>. Search is what is typed in the prompt and includes brings back boolean</li>
            <li>array example excercise <a href="Excercises/js_e6_010420.html"></a></li>
            <li>A two dimensional array is an array that holds other arrays, dont forgot the , after the arrays - Example: <br>
              <img src="Images/two dimensional array.jpg" alt=""> <br>
              First array is at index 0, second index 2 and so on. Just like a normal array <br>
              To get a value from within one array it would look like <b>grades[2][0]</b>. This says get the first value in the third array</li>
            <li>A two dimensional array that hold a playlist of songs with the artists <br>
              <img src="Images/two dimensional array playlist.jpg" alt=""></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Day 5</h2>
          <p>Objects in Javascript</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Javascript is commonly known as a object oriented software, strings, booleans, functions and so on are either objects or treated as objects</li>
              <li>An object is something that either has a property or a meathod</li>
              <li>Example - an array is a object as it has properties such as .length or meathods such as .push</li>
              <li>A key or property is like a variable and the value for that key or property is like a value for a variable</li>
              <li>Example for for a object in a variable <br>
                <b>var student = {};</b> <br>
                <img src="Images/Object Example.jpg" alt=""></li>
              <li>When adding values in a object you dont use a ; - Example <b>name : "Sarah",</b></li>
              <li>You can add everything to an object, string, number, boolean, array and so on</li>
              <li>To access a property of a object you use a key. <br>
                <img src="Images/accessing a object V1.jpg" alt=""> <br>
                <img src="Images/accessing a object V2.jpg" alt=""></li>
              <li>To assign a new value to a property in a object you use <b>person.name = "Bobby";</b>. Name is the key and person is the object <br>
                <img src="Images/assign a value to a key in the object.jpg" alt=""></li>
              <li>To create a new property on an object you use <b>person.country = "Brazil";</b>. Person is the object and country will be the new property</li>
              <li>An object can be seen as a package of variables</li>
              <li>a return would normally only return one value but when returning a object you can return all the values of the object</li>
              <li>The loop used for an object is called <b>a for in loop</b>. This loops through each key and property in the object</li>
              <li>An example of a for in loop. <b>for</b> and <b>var</b> and <b>in</b> cant be changed but propName is just like i in for loops<br>
                <img src="Images/for in loop example.jpg" alt=""></li>
              <li>Another for in loop example <br>
                <img src="Images/for in loop example V2.jpg" alt=""> <br>
                <img src="Images/for in loop example V2 console.jpg.jpg" alt=""></li>
              <li>Remember, const does not prevent the arrays and objects assigned to variables from being modified; it only prevents the variable itself from being reassigned or overwritten completely. <br>
                  For example, attempting to override person to equal another object literal throws an error. Person being the const variable</li>
              <li>If you hve an array or object assigned to a const variable you can override the variable itself but you can add to the object or array</li>
              <li>Example of converting a two dimentional array into object making it easier to call out <br>

                <img src="Images/Array to object function change.jpg" alt=""></li>
              <li>JSON stands for javascript object notation - used a lot with ajax to exchange data with a server and web browser <br>
                <img src="Images/Example of json.jpg" alt=""></li>

        <p>The Treehouse Javascript course is now complete I will have to use <a href="https://www.codewars.com/" target="_blank">Code Wars</a> to practice what I have learned</p>
      <h2>The landscape of Javascript</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is everywhere and used in all phases of development from software to hardware. <br>
          This course walks you through the modern landscape of JavaScript, and what it means to learn and program with JavaScript in 2018 and beyond.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Javascript can run just about anywhere in both software and hardware</li>
            <li>Javascript started out in the browser in 1995</li>
            <li>Netscape was the browser that incoprated more than text and images with user interaction. <br>
              The program used in netscape for interaction in the browser was called scheme</li>
            <li>Scheme never took of becuase the developer was actually asked to start working on <b>Mocha</b> which is now javascript</li>
            <li>It went from Mocha to <b>LiveScript</b> to than <b>JavaScript</b>.</li>
            <li>What is being covered in this section <br>
              <img src="Images/Landscape of Javascript.jpg" alt=""> <br>
              notes - JavaScript's design decisions were mostly influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme. <br>
              The object-oriented and prototype-based programming language Self inspired JavaScript’s prototypal inheritance, and Scheme likely influenced its functional and imperative styles of programming.</li>
            <li>Javascript started out in the browser now is included in anything that requires user interaction.</li>
            <li>The website <a href="http://lookbook.wedze.com/winter-2017-2018/" target="_blank">lookbook.wedze.com</a> is a good example of javascript in a website.</li>
            <li>Air bnb, Tesla and instagram and just some app that use javascript</li>
            <li>Javascript is good when running on IOT device. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things" target="_blank">IOT Explained</a> <br>
              IOT is a physical device with an onn/off switch that can connect to the internet and with other IOT devices</li>
            <li>To run javascript outside of the browser <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js" target="_blank">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">nodejs.org</a></li>
            <li>After the browser netscape had javascript other browsers like IE implements something like JScript <br>
              This made cross browser compatability difficult for developers</li>
            <li>In 1996 netscape standardize things submittied to ecma international which was industry standard</li>
            <li>You can have different flavours of javascript <br>
              Plain Javascript <img src="Images/Plain javascript.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>Moving forward now a new release of ECMAScript javascript get release every year</li>
            <li>You also have type checkers for Javascript. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0U2zeG2SBI" target="_blank">Info Video</a> <br>
              <img src="Images/Typecheckers for JavaScript.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">Type script</a> is a type of type checker built by Microsoft. Essentially a layer around JavaScript. <br>
              The browser doesnt understand type script so it needs to get compiled to javaScript code</li>
            <li><a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a> is a JavaScript library used to add interactivity to web pages. <br>
              It's a commonly used tool found in tens of millions of sites and apps all over the web and popular front-end frameworks. <br>
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMxGhHNOkCU" target="_blank">J Query explained</a></li>
            <li>JavaScript is a dynamic/scripting lanuage, this runs at run time. browsers have a built in interpreter/JavaScript engine for JavaScript. <br>
              <img src="Images/Javascript browser engines.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li>JIT Just In Time compliers are used in browsers, coverts JS code for browsers and machines on the fly</li>
            <li>Text editors that are good are <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime</a>, <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a> and <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> </li>
            <li>Linters and Formatters are useful to setup in text editors - making sure indentation and syntax is correct: <br>
              Linters - <a href="https://eslint.org/" target="_blank">ESLint</a>.<a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/2364" target="_blank">Difference between Prettier and ESLint</a> <br>

            <li>Node.js is another common JavaScript runtime environment</li>
            <li>Before starting your javascript project creating a build system would be good, see what is included <br>
