      <p>Some notes on Javascript providing a understanding. 
      <br>Built into the browser
      <br>Lots of tools to make life easier
      <br>Lots of data types <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp">Data Types</a>
      <br>  
      </p>
    <h2>Usefull notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>q</b> is used to quit out of a command</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Day 1</h2>
    <p>Javascript has three types of variables Const, Let and var</p>
      <ul>
          <li>To reassign a value in javascript you can use +=</li>
          <li>const variables - The value of the variable should remain constant. Once assigned a value you cant later down the code assign another value</li>
          <li>let variables lets you update the value of the variable but never reassign the value.</li>
          <li>var variables - You are able to assign a value to a variable at anytime, even when a variable has been assigned a value earlier on </li>
          <li>Javascript has the data type string, example "Hello world!"</li>
          <li>If you start a string with " end with ", can also use ' <br> How to decide on which one will determine what is in your string example if you use I'm than use "</li>
          <li>If you use a \ infront of a ' than javascript will treat this as a normal charector</li>
          <li>If you want to write a string on mutiple lines use a \ at the end of each line</li>
          <li>Javascript has many properties that make it easier to perform simple tasks <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_properties.asp"> Properties</a> <br> Example = passphrase.length give you the length of the variable passphrase <br> passphrase is a object and length is the property.</li>
          <li>A meathod is something you can do to a string <br> Example = toUpperCase()</li>
          <li><b>Properties are like nouns. They have a value or state. Methods are like verbs. They perform actions.</b></li>
          <li></li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Day 2</h2>
    <p>Start things of with a recap and than proceed</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Start things of with a challange to build a word game, Your gona ask for an adjective, verb and noun and than make a story out of this. <br> see javascript file for the game <a href="js_e1_260320.html">JS_E1_260320</a></li>
      <h3>Conditional Statements</h3>
         <li>An example of a conditional formatting is were in the previous excercise you asked for a name, the condition can be that it has to be a string</li>
         <li>example of this would be the code <br>
        const answer = prompt('which planet is closet to the sun?'); <br>
        if (answer.toUpperCase === 'MERCURY') { <br>
          console.log("That's Correct"); <br>
        } else { <br>
             console.log("thats incorrect"); <br>
             } <br>
         --- You can add a .toUpperCase to answer in the if statement ensuring that answer inserted is always in capitals <br>
          </li>
      <h3>Comparison Operators</h3>
          <li>Here are just some comparison Operators Comparison <br> <img src="C:\Users\SEISMI020\Desktop\Git Practice\Operators.jpg" alt=""> </li>
          <li>In Javascript when using the comparison's, Javascript reacts true and false.</li>
          <li>Booleans return true or false. All conditions returna true or false value. true and false are not strings no '' <br>
          <img src="C:\Users\SEISMI020\Desktop\Git Practice\boolean example.jpg" alt=""></li>
          <li>you can also use a else if in a if statement. You only use else if if the first else is false.</li>
          <li>add two conditions to a if statement <br>
          && means something and something <br></li>
          <li>When using the or operator <b>||</b> you have to have full conditions on both sides</li>
          <li>Document your code - Consider other developers. <br> To leave a comment use <b>//</b> or multi line comment <b>/* */</b> or in line - after code <b>//</b> <br>
          Use comments when you are doing something complex <br>
          You can also comment out code</li>
          <li>A challange to build a quiz game, ask 5 questions and depending on the score you get a trophy <br> see javascript file for the game <a href="js_e2_260320.html">JS_E2_260320</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Day 3</h2>
    <p>Javascript Numbers</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data types for javascript: <br>
          Strings - series of number and letters enclosed in ""
          Boolean - is either is true of false
          Numbers - Numeric data types, counting and calculating</li>
        <li>a Interger is a whole number, either positive or negative number. It has no decimal places </li>
        <li>Floating point numbers are used to represent fractional values and include a decimal point.</li>
        <li>This is an integer value -- scientific notation uses the letter 'e' to represent an exponential value.</li>
        <p>Developers frequently use numbers for performing calculations; you'll likely spend a lot of time working with numbers in JavaScript. If you create a game, for example, you'll need to keep track of a player's score. If you build an eCommerce site, you'll need to figure out the total cost of items in a visitor's shopping cart. And if you want to calculate the number of days until your next birthday, you'll need to use numbers and do some math.</p>
        <li>Arithmetic Operators - JavaScript lets you perform most mathematical calculations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</li>
        <li>There are shorthand methods for performing each of the basic mathematical operations on a variable: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. For example, to add 10 to the contents of a variable, use += 10. This both adds 10 to the current variable and assigns the result back into the variable. <br>
        There are also shorthands for subtracting from a variable, multiplying a variable by a value, and dividing a variable by a value. <br>
         <img src="C:\Users\SEISMI020\Desktop\Git Practice\short hand.jpg" alt=""></li>
        <li>Time excercise <a href="js_e3_270320.html">js_e3_270320</a></li>
        <li>When a user inputs a number javascript treats this like a string, example a webform.</li>
        <li>You can use <b>typeof</b> before the variable so it displays if it is a string</li>
        <li>To convert a string to a number you can use <b>parseInt</b> <br>
          Example <b>const fruit = parseInt(melons) + parseInt(oranges);</b>
          Melons and orange have been given numbers by the user through a propmt</li>
        <li><b>parseFloat</b> is like the above but for decimal numbers</li>
        <li>For the above parseInt and parseFloat you can just use + before the variable and does the same thing. </li>
        <p>Random Numbers</p>
        <li>Javascript treats strings, numbers and booleans as objects, a object is a wrap around that data type</li>
        <li>Javascript objects have many properties example is <b>object.length</b></li>
        <li>Javascript objects have many meathods example is <b>object.toUppercase()</b></li>
        <li> <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math">Math Object</a> Meathods and Properties </li>
        <li>Example of a math meathod <b>Math.round(2.2)</b> this rounds the number up</li>
        <li>Create a random number using Javascript <b>Math.random()</b> This returns a decimal place number between 0 and 1 but never 1</li>
        <li>To get Math.random() to return a random number between 1 and 6 you do <b>Math.random() * 6;</b></li>
        <li>Math.floor() rounds the number down and Math.ceil() rounds the number up <br>
          Both pass the whole number if the number is not a decimal place</li>
        <li>Example of the two above <b>Math.floor( Math.random() * 6 )</b> This gives me a whole number between 0 and 5</li>
        <li>To have the above to give me a number between one and 6 I do <b>Math.floor( Math.random() * 6 ) + 1;</b></li>
        
      </ul>
