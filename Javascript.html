    <h2>Day 1</h2>
    <p>Javascript has three types of variables Const, Let and var</p>
      <ul>
          <li>To reassign a value in javascript you can use +=</li>
          <li>const variables - The value of the variable should remain constant. Once assigned a value you cant later down the code assign another value</li>
          <li>let variables lets you update the value of the variable but never reassign the value.</li>
          <li>var variables - You are able to assign a value to a variable at anytime, even when a variable has been assigned a value earlier on </li>
          <li>Javascript has the data type string, example "Hello world!"</li>
          <li>If you start a string with " end with ", can also use ' <br> How to decide on which one will determine what is in your string example if you use I'm than use "</li>
          <li>If you use a \ infront of a ' than javascript will treat this as a normal charector</li>
          <li>If you want to write a string on mutiple lines use a \ at the end of each line</li>
          <li>Javascript has many properties that make it easier to perform simple tasks <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_properties.asp"> Properties</a> <br> Example = passphrase.length give you the length of the variable passphrase <br> passphrase is a object and length is the property.</li>
          <li>A meathod is something you can do to a string <br> Example = toUpperCase()</li>
          <li><b>Properties are like nouns. They have a value or state. Methods are like verbs. They perform actions.</b></li>
          <li></li>
      </ul>
